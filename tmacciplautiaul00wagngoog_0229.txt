The ιοιοοοο Punica is only here mentioned; Weise says ‘iorte e uitro
iactsz' and this opinion seems not quite without foundation, when we
· consider that the invention of glass is generally ascribed ιο the Phoe·
nicians.—Beaumont and Fletcher, poets who like to show their learning,

manifestly imitate this passage in ‘rsa Scorafal Lody’ 11 3 p. 301 ed.

559. ‘Qui opus aliquod, hoc est materiam aliquam efformandam
effingendam elaborandam alicui tradit, is locare: amatae uero qui illud
opus suscipiat, dicitur.' Lindemann on Capt. 1v 2, 39. coradacere is here
simply to hay, locare in the next line ιο pat out. Euclio plays upon the
word locare which would remind every oue oi the phrase sanae locare
ito contraot with an undertakes about a funeral! This becomes the
more pungent, as Euclio advises Megadorus to bespeak the lamb's frme-
ral while it is still alive.
