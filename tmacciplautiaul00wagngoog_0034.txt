11 is long in puter Aul. 772. Trin. 645⁹. It has the same quantity
in three passages in Virgil,Aeo. v 521. 11469. 1111 13. 'l'he- fact is
well accounted for by Prof. Key, Lat. Grani. p. 437. Το Oorssen's
objections (uusspr. 1, 362) Ι cannot attach the least importante. He
puts astreas on the fact that the 1 of the nom disappeare in the other

cases, and holds thieto be a proof of its ehortnees: how, then, would
he account for the η of πατήρ, which, neverthelees‚ makes πατρός in the

was always long⁸. Thus we havefidei Aul 575.

patiore which sometimes preserve their original long quantity contrary
1ο the general usage of the Augustan period

In Plautus' prosody all those endings may be long where 111 original
vowel is contracted with the rootvowel of the verb. Thus he has not
only

11 es ts = cis cisiis
which even later times did not deviate from, but we find in his verses
the third persone analogously long:

dt dl 11 = (111111ἱὶ1
This is admitted on all sides; see Key, Lat. (iram. p. 428, who quotes
Ritschl'e Proll. Tria. cnxxmu. Prof. Key justly adds: ‘There are
not wanting similar examples in Virgil and Horace3 but editors and

teachers complacently get over the difficulty by attributing the unusual
length 1ο the so·called principle of caesura, orto poetica] licence' Ι am

sorry to see the same error in Pavry’e Introduction to Terence p. nv,
where the subjunctive augeat (Ter. Ad. prol. 25> is attributed to the
influence cf ‘ictua’: but the ending at, just ss well as brit in the imperf„
was originally long, as will be seen from the second persons ds dds and
