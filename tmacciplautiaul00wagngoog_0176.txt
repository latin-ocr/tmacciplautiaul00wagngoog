Tne greatu part of the Plautian prologues being spurious and pre-
fixed tc the comedies of the poet long aster his death, it is very
very doubtful whether the prologus to the Aulularia ean behold to
have been written by the poet himself It is true, none of the argn-
ments alleged against the rest of the prologues by Ritschl (Pur. 1209
-226) ean be applied to this: ¹on the contrary, this prologus is
remarkably distinguished for its simple grace and unaffected language.
Aa regards the question, whether it is necessary or not, we agree
entirely with Thorntou who justly observas: ‘There seems to be no
reason, why any account at all need be given for how many genera·
tiens the treasure had remained undiscovered in the old miser’s family,’
though at the sama tima wa must confess, that to give such infor-
mation no fitter person could be found than the Lar familiaris.
Moreover, the introduction of this Deity is quita conformable tc the
habit of the writers of the socalled New Comedy (see Meineke‚ Meo.
et Philam. rell. 1823 p. 284) which Plautus seems to have followed
here as well as in the prologues to the Rudens and the 'hinummus
On these grounds, I was first inclined to attribute this prologus to
Plautus himself (de Aalrd. p. 29), but without taking into considera·
tion a metrieal reason subsequently suggested by Brix, via that the
writer uses the word accacius v. 35 as quadrisyllabic, while Plautus
himself has it as trisyllabis ermolao (v. 677. 772. 792), in accordance
with a popular pronunciation which we find confirmed by some in·

¹ scriptions (see Oorsren, casspr. 1, 138). It seems therefore safer to
v return to Bernhardy's opinion (rdmisolw litteraturyeschiclrle, 1865, p.

442) who ascribes this prologus to an older hand than the others,
though we may allow the universal character and even the whole idea
