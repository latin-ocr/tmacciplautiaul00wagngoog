licus ‘eet qai uocales acciit coniungere! The only question which 'is 'still
aab iudice is therefore, how far the comio poets indulged in a licenoe
which we must admit they used in their metues.

‘Parry, in his Introduction to Terence, p. nvn sets down three rules
which would serve to explain the admissibility of hiatus, vin: hiatus,-
he says, is justified,

(1) by the sense of the passage,
(2) by the punctuation,

(3) in exclamations, such as salehach ebo heus.

Setting aeide the third rule, which has indeed a general value for
all Latin poets, we confine ourselves to a more detailed discussion of

the first two rules. We may define the matter more accurately in the
following manner.

Hiatus is justified:
(a) where the line is divided among two or more speakers,
(b) by caesura.

. The latter point in its full extent was long disputed by Ritschl, but
at last he began to allow a greater freedom and to relax the severity os
his original views‚ as will be scen in the instance of the hiatus in the
caesura of the trochaic septenarius (praef Men. p. x ss.) This occurs
in the delatoria v. 174. 250. 638. But he does not allow a hiatus in
the caesura of an iambic senarius ‘ac quae ia aredium ordinem rhyti-
rnicum incidot’ (Proll. p. oxcw). Stil] he donatos from this law in such
an instance as Tria. 432

= temptet adeundi :r estne hic Philto qui aduenit

because in this case the lineis divided among two speakers. In the
Aulularia we have two instanccs of the same kind oi hiatus, via 305
and 530:

immo equidem credo :z at scin etiam quomodo?
ain addicisti? :r sisque a principio omnia.

In both instances it would not be very difficult to avoid the hiatus
by writing set instead of ot in the first, and inserting aie before usqae
in the second line. But as a hiatus of this kind is by no means very
rare, wc shall adhere to the authority of our MSS.
