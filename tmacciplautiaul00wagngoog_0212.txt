the line such as it' actually appears in tbe MSS. cai ia re arlia (ie toli

iarn) aehcehr’t antidhcc: *does it not look like an explanatory note added
by a grammarian ‘this god in former times helped people in such dis-

tress as this’l The present metrical form is apparently dus to the cor·
rectione of scribes—aratidhac isin fact the sameas antehoc which is
the reading found in Jand all the late MSS„ except in γ, and even there
aratidhoc iswritten by the second hand, while the first hand bad αοιισΙιοο.
Phe full form of the preposition arete was ararit or aated (comp. postid
prod red): Oorssen, aasspr. 1, 337. Prot Key holds that hae in antehoc
posthac praeterhac isa corrupted form of an original accusative (L G.

l 802): in the same way we should have postilla praterea oraha etc.
with the loss of a final ου the gender would be accounted for by an
ellipsis ofrem. Of course, Prof. Key would hold thesemo opinion with
regard to adeo, where we should thus have an original accusative
eom. But first of all, the long quantity of the final a in praeterea
etc. or the ὃ in adeo would be left unexplained On the other hand,
itis a well attested fact that inthe oldest period of the Latin langnage
theuso of the cases after certain propositione was far from being fixed
and uniform. To quote an instance from the mwtasc. de Boe, we have
there adorsam ead: where ead cannot be an accusative, as vulgar igno·
rance would conjectur03 in the case of the prepositions suh and matter
the language always remained in a fluctuating state ς with regard to ia
it is known that the best Latin writers sometimes have a‘a arentem eat
and similar constructione. Why should wo not therefore regard antehoc
praeterhac antea praeterea etc. as real ablativesl See also Corssen,
aasspr. 2, 266. .

already been suggested by Hare in his ms. notes, where he comparas

thesaurarius appears a ἅπαξ λεγ.

396. With this line a passage from Ter. Ad. 111 3, 23 ss. is gene·
rally compared. From reminiscences of this and other passages of the
' same kind the old dittography may have arisen which we here find in
all our MSS. The word erdorsreare occurs only hers and in Appuleius.
—Perhaps the reading attested by the MSS. of Nonius, potes, should be
kept: seo note on v. 119.

397. In our text the misprint aradam should be corrected in ritem
datm. For the explanation of the passage see Pliny as quoted in the
critical notes, pistor in Plautian language always means ‘a miller,'
never ‘a baker': see a passage from Varro de aito p. r. quoted by
Nonius p. 152 ‘aee protecte acmen erat aiei eius qai rard far pinsehot?
Το bake bread was therefore one of the duties of hired cocks ’
