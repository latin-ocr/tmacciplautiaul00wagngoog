xxx INTRODUGTION.

guage‚ when first used 166 literary purposes, had already lost final con·
sonante: e. g. from the original genitives

666666-16 sarucia 6616
we have after the loss 61116 final a

mensal 666661 . 661

mensae serui 66

The formation 61 116 611 sing. gives us another instance. Originally
this case ended iu d : eumad seruod patred muaud red: this d was
however dropt thera as well as in the adverbs furilcd etc, which
were originally ablatives. These 166666 ars previous to Plautus’ time,
aud in his language we find but obscure traces of them left We
read in a few 166166666 6 nom. plur. 61 116 sec. decl. in ia', and the

166666 used and tedere still used hy Plautus, not hy Terence. (See
note on v. 120). We may now proceed to enumerate 11666 166166666

where final consonante are dropt (i. 6. do not count with regard to versi·
fication) in Plautus and Terence, contrary to the usage 61 116 later or
classical language.

ua We learn from Priscian r 38 (Hertz) ‘m abacorum ia eatre-
mitcte (1161166666 acuat} and Quintilian means the same 1x 4, 40 ((66)
parumn exprimitur...acquc 66166 6661661166, sed obscuratur) On account
61 116 waak sound‚ a final m was 61166 neglected in writing both in
nouus and verbs, 66 will he seen in numerous instaures collected from
the oldest inscriptions hy Oorssen, oauspr. 1, 110. This disregard 61 6

final m seems to have been quite familiar to all the popular dialects
61 16116 throughout its different periodS, and hence we have to explain

’ hexameters ending 6661161166 idcircum, 16666ᾶέ66 figuram (quoted from
Meyer'sAnthology1223, 1. dr 1171, 4 1611116611, riwin. mua. xiv 389)².
We shall therefore not he surprised to find many instanoes in which a

final m 16 entirely discarded in Plautian prosody‚ e. g. 6166666116 16 16
pronounced as domu Aul. 148 dvc. We shall 1666661 give any special
instances 61 1116 fact, but it will be useful 1ο draw the pa1ticularat-

1 See Bitschl‚ rheinisches 66666666 rx 158.

² Α pentameter ends with the words 6166166166 post ibid. 166616 the final m
must 61666666 be dropt.
