In the passive, the shortening propensities 011110 Latin languege
have chiefly displayed themselves in the first person of the singular. In
Plautus we find sometimes the original quantities or ert nay ferde· 10
met with as late as Ovid (Met. vn 61). Analogously, the endings er

and rer in the suhj. were originally long.
It may finally he remarked that with the comio poete er (‘thou

art') is invariably long.

B. IRREGULAR SHORTEN IN G OF LONG FINAL VOWELS.

All these long vowels are, however, of but 0οο01101101 occurrence
in Plautus and Terence—they are, indeed, nothing more than a few
scattered traces of a period of the language, which was rapidly waning
and dying away. The penerel character of the language in the times
01 Plautus was quite different A destructive clement had already
commenced 111 powerful influence upon the language, and had already
deeply affected and altered the original quantity of many endings and
01010100011001-10001101101111 worda The 0000111111 Latin never
falls on the 1001 syllable, and 111 tendency was 10 destroy the length
01 this last syllable⁸, especially in case the word was disyllabic and
had 0 short penult.

We find, therefore, in Plautus more instances in which the above
mentioned archaic long vowels have been shortened than where they
still retain their original quantity—and this must be attributed 10 the
influence 01 the accent. But the language did not stop there ,· on the
contrary, many short quantities are 1ο be found in the comio poeta

which were either entirely rejected 01 hut exceptionally admitted by
10101 poets.
