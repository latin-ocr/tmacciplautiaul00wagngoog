at a fitter time and placa-leoat aetaliae, an intensifying λιτότης for
oetas ‘you would be quite ready! For the form see note on v. 154.

285. Congrio replica thathe meant operam dare v. 282 in a different
sense, not obscenely as Antrax would insinuate. —aliouoraam dicare:
comp. Ter. an. 12, 2 aliouorseaa accipere.

286. isiacis here adverb=istoc, see Key, L. G. ξ eea-Strobilus in·
tends to avoid all further quarrel and says therefore aad emes dec. ‘but to
come 1ο the point, my master is going 1ο marry! For this usage of aad ’
see Zumpt ξ 739.

289. lactucis here monosyllabic=leaia, seeIntrod.p.Lv11. ⁴

291. ‘ Do you maan to say that you are going to send one half here,
the other to your own houset’

292. nempe has its first syllable short: see Intrcd. p. xnvr.

Ι299. The same expression filici nuptiis occurs v. 970. 592. 790. In
these three passages the Mss. rightly omit ia, which must· be omitted,
since the final c' in filiai cannot be elided: comp. Lachmann, Lucr. p.
161. In this passage we are at liberty to take nuptiis either as a dative
or an ablativa (see Key, L. G. § 992. Zumpt § 475), but in tha others it
must be ablativa. .

295. This was a proverbial expression, comp. Perso1 l, 41 aquom

a feminine, see Priscian V1 712 (R), e. g. in Catull. 1, 2 wo should read
acida codo pumice expolitam, not crido (Haupt, quaest. Cat. p. 6).
Servius on Aen. ΧΗ 587 ‘pumicem autem ista (Vergilius) masculino genere
posuit, et Isaac acquietum· aare et Plautus ita aaa seems to allude to
thie passage in the Aulularia.

296. taedam expresses Congrio's unwillingness to believe what
Strobilus tells him. See Zumpt § 237.

297. qaia here and v. 300 means ‘evenzs see Zumpt 5542. If
found with an indicative, this particle is quite different in origin from
qaia c. coni. In the latter case, it is a compound of the relative pro-
nouu qui and the original negation aa· in the first, it is the interro-
gative qai and aa. In translating it by ‘wby,’ vva may preserve its
original meaning.
