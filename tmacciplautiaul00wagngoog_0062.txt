Now, a host of other instanees is still lest unexplained and will be
unaccounted for, unless we really admit the truth of the general law
which is found at the head of the present section. We cannot of
course promise to give all, or nearly all, the instanees which must
henes be explained, but it will be usefirl to mention seme prominent

examples, were it only as a brief exemplification of our law. By
diligently reading Plautian poetry, a rhythmical ear will soon become
accustomed ιο these licences of prosedy, and when onos familiar with
them, the reader will not fail to discover the wonderful vivacity and

clasticity of the comic versification of the Romans, a laet which would
have been perfectly impossible, had the Latin language always been
bound by the prosodiaeal fetters which, since Ennius’ time, restrained
its youthful agility and turned it into a slew, but majestic and pompona
amay. still, these words shall by no means depretiata Ennius' merita:
sor it was he who preserved the language from premature decay and
dilapidatien

We may first draw the reade1²s particular attention ιο two little
pronouns which, on account of their frequent occurrence, were liable ιο
an uncertain mode of pronunciatien. We mean ipae and r‘ate: and both
occasionally being enclitics‚ it was, of course, left ιο the individual
liberty ef the speaker, which place ιο assign ιο them in his sentence,
ie. either ιο run over them by connecting them with the preceding
word, or ιο give them more importance by fully pronouncing their first
syllable. In the first ease these pronouns would be pyrrhiehs, in the
latter trochees, and accordingly they appear in Plautus and Terence in
both shapes: iate has even a secondary form rte, which was first dis·
covered by Lachmann, on Luer. p. 197¹: in the same way we may
fairly presumc the existence of an analogous form pse, though there are

no historieal documenta for it ¹.
