- as the line stands not only in Jy and the recent MSS.² but in B ineu
(see Addenda).

Two other instances which might he alleged, are doubtful. The
first is v. 504,

stat lullo phrugio aurifex linarias.

In this case wo may notice that B gives phyrgio, a reading which
could bo supported hya great many analogous examples of other
words¹‚ though it istrue that this form of the word seems to occur
nowhere else. Ii therefore wo could confidently say that a hiatus was in
this lino an impossibility, wo should have to give phurqio in our text

In v. 44 we have other reasons which lead us to presumo that some '

word was omitted in B. See critical note.
In the caesura ἕφθημιμερὴς Ritschl allows a hiatus Pseud. 1079:

sat conuenistino hominem τε immo ambos simul

because the line is divided among two speakers This isthe same casa
as aaz. 562:

non potem 030² quidem hercle :: at ego iussero.

And in accordance'with this Ι have ventured to give the reading of
the MSS. v. Ill:

nam non est ueri simile, hominem¹ pauperem

though it is easy to transpose ucri amida aaa est.

But there is a general law which proteots a great many passages in
Plautus in which a hiatus occurs, from tha corrections of modern scholare.
We owe its discovery to Prof. Fleckeisen. It is as follows:

All monosyllables urmimtiag ia a long vowel or m aecd aot coalesco
with a following short vowel.

Illustrations of this law will bo seen in such passages as Scala
321. Aul. 707. 708. Glor. 1330.
