137. The accentuation optuma would be star'tling to those who
believe in a general tendency of Plautian prosody to preserve the com-
mon accentuation 01 daily life. There are, however, many 1110100000 01
such metrical paroxytona as optume to be found in Plautus and the other
comic poets Gomp. desine (Naeu. 60. Gaec. 60. Ribb.). piscibus Rud.

would in all these cases adopt the common accentuation, for in 1110 paper-
ί011 Greek accentuation’ (Transact. of the Phil. S. 1855 p. 134) 10 says
that ‘Greek [and Latin] iambics agreed with our own [English] in the

In the latter instance, Prof. Koy would no doubt treet 0151 as a monosyl-
lable (see ‘Alphabet’ p. 147 and L. G. § 1172 0010)-01 pronunciation
which Ι should however not admit (see Introd. p. xv note). The only
arguments which could be alleged 101 0 theory which is somuch opposed
10 our common metrical ereed, seem to rest on some Greek iambica
which however admit 01 01101 explanatione: in Παρθὲνοπαῖος (Sept ad
Theb. 553) 01111Ἱππόμέδοντος (ib. 484) 110 antecedent vowels are length·
ened by the influence 01 the following liquida, which were notoriously
of a very strong pronunciation in the inlaut. Ι may add that 1. 553
10 considered spurious by Dindosf and Weil‚ not on account 01 the
quantity 01 Παρθενοπαῖος, but on other grounds, Iu v. 484 Ritschl
conjectures μέγ’ Ἱππομέδοντος σχῆμα καὶ μέγας τρόπος, where the legiti·
mate quantity would be preserved. In Ἀλφὲσίβοιαν (Soph. fragm.) 110
easily recognise the same process as in the Homeric dative πάντεσσι

instead 01 πάντεσι dre. But Prof. Key contenda also that in such a line
as soph. 1111. 140

τί stre πέπονθας ; οὐκ ἐρεῖς, ἀλλ’ ὧδ’ ἔσει

we ought to Ρι·01100110οτίπτε (01 least so Ι understand his words). This
would indeed be the same as the beginning 01 an English 10111110 111010
