the spoken languago used milvos and baruc, and that the vocalisation of
the v was due to the usage of the poets.

Pseud. 11 2, 37 might be translated five hundred times.

320. Cooks used to have a bad repnte at Rome, as the whole scene
in the Pseudulus 111 2 between Ballio and the cook shows. celeres
meatus are an attribute of thieves, e. g. in a line quoted from Plautus’
Corniculana (p. 1470 Taubm.) miti, Laustasa, iufiertis celerassis mous.
Congrio himself prays to Laverna, v. 442. Δ

321. Perhaps it would be better to give the words cocum eqo me
dico to Congrio, who would not be silent when proroked by Strobilus’
taunting expressions. Autrax, on the contrary, answers when aalred
quid tu aiat In such matters as these we need not too anxiously
depend upon the Mes-With sic sum ut uides comp. Theocr. Id. mr

322. The explanation of the expression comas paradisorum not
quite settled, and we leam from Festus (see crit. notes) that eren in
ancient times the grammarians were not quite agreed with regard to
this passage. nundinatio would come from nundinae (mammae,
Corssen, cusspr. l, 137) and would of course mean a very bad and
worthless cooir hired only on marketdays. But I should far prefer the
other reading which is clearly indicated by Festus, but generally cou-
founded with nundinales, and thia is condiatis. accendistis are ex·
plained in an old glossary ivaro ἐπὶ νεκροῦ ἀγόμενα (see e. g. Patron. 65):
eomas nomaso would thus signify a cook hired for the socalled ‘sili-
cernium’ and for festivals of that nature not the best coolrs seem to
have been generally hired. Thalem Ballio says oia very bad cook
in this sense quia ob eume rem Orcus recipere od se Iram mles, Vt esset
hic qua· mmet oenum coquat: Pseud. 795 s. Ι should not therefore
hesitate to write mundialia.

324. Congrio is not slow to understand Autrax's meaning, and
pays him back with interest. Antrax gives him the titleof a thies (Fva),
