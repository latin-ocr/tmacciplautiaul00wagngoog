102 · exnenrlonn COMMENTARY.

about Nothing 11 4 ‘ste speaks pantardum every word uaea’ The
contrary is expressed by Aristophanes Nub. 910 ῥόδα μ’ εἴρηκας.

154. pereudie ‘the day afterz‘ this is the original meaning of this
word which will thus 66 constently met with in Plautus Oomp. the
phrase used in the legis actioms ‘iu diem tertium siue pmeudiuum'
(see Bergk, rtem mus. xrx 606) and Merc. 378 crae agite, 66666616
agite. Megadorus seems 16 hare the same opinion of married life which
Hipponax expresses 16 166 following lines δύ’ ἡμέραι γυναικός εἰσιν
ἧδισταί,Ὀταν γαμῇ τις κᾶκφέρῃ τεθνηκυῖαν. Another sentence of the same
kind is reported oi Chaeremon γυναῖκα θάπτειν κρεῖσσόν ἐστιν ἦ γαμεῖν.
[The comma aster perendie is due to the printer, not the editor]

157. The reading of this line is not quite settled. In the reading
adopted in our text we have the final syllable in grandior long (see
Introd. p. svm) and the last syllable in mulieris as anceps, which in
the caesura may be excused. I am now inclined to read sed ts grdudior
6616, medicat mulieris uetus: where the short quantity of es would have
to be added to the similar instances enumerated Introd, p. nnn—aetas
audie, 1. 6. iuter mmm iuuenemque, sed proprior 6661, as Seneca expremes
it Oed 776. (liccro has media uetus de 666. 17, 60 and 20, 76.

159. mais] Oomp. muelles v. 284 and see Key, L G. 5 734.

161. Megadorus contemptuously calls a wife of somewhst maturer

years uuus, to express that she is nearly old enough to deservo this title
The epitheta senex and uuus are, however, not to be talren as expres
sions of a very old age, they being sometimes applied to persons of about
45 to 50 years. E g. Amphitruo is called sema in the comedy bearing

his name v l, 20. 1v 2, 12, though he seems a newly·married man ‘in
the prime of his years)

161. postumus 16 6 formation of the same kind as iufumus imuusus
extamus: sce Key, L. G. § 823. It generally means a son born after
his iather's death, but sometimes even sons born when their fathers
were very old were called so. See Virgil, Aea. vt 763 Siluius,
Albanum uouceu, tua postuma protes, 41666 tihi hrreyeeuo merem Lauinio
coutume Educet 611616. Gellius gives us the note of 66 ancient gram·
marian, Caesellius, on this passage ‘postuma proles 666 eum siymssmt
qui petre mortuo, sed qui postremo loco uatus est. sicuti Siluius qui
dama ium seue tardo seroque partu est editus! 11661611 6 16 with
Gronovius' note. '

163. degum, 166 reading found in Nonius, could be defended hy
Epid. 1 1, 63 deyetur comum de teryo meo, where B and the Palatina
MSS. give detegetur, while Nonius has degatur. It is however much

more probable that Plautus himself wrote deumm et deminuam: see
note on w. 49. Itis now evident hy the express testimony cf Schwen-
