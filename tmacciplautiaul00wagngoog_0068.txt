and even 11 1111 1 word as ubstodcbta' the first syllable appears shortened
Aac. 637 ⁸. It is very difficult now to find these instanoes in Bitschl’s
text⁴, since they are 111 eliminated by means of conjectures sometimes

very arbitrary eg. Glor. 1411111 MSS. (ABG) would give us the
following text: -

perque tua genua t quid obsecras me? :: inscitiae
meae ct stultitiae ignoscas. nune demam scio

In this case quid obsecras mc would be 1 very natural and oon-

venient question, the slave having said two lines before tc obsecro.
Ilitschl gives, however, as follows:

perque tua genua :: quid iam? :: meae ut inscitiae
1111111 stultitiae ignoscas. nunc demdm scio

¹ This is the reading 11111 the MSS. and Fleckeisen’s edition gives the line in
accordance with it. Bitschl’s however transposes dpamwbc epo.

² Fleckeisen (ep. crit. m) was inclined to transpose dictum spaurde. He would
not do 11 now.

³ A Satmnian line oi Livius Andronicus seems 11 testify to the short quantity
oi the syllable -upa in scrupeorum:

apud nsrmiam Atlantis filiam Calupsdnem.

This is at least Biicheler's opinion, jahrb. fiir 11111. phil. 1863 p. 332.

⁴ As regards Fleckeisen’s text, we must draw the reader's attention to the great
difference between his first and second volume. In the first he depende almost
entirely on Ritschl’s principles, while in the second he is more conservative in
consequence oi the metrical and rhythmioal discoveries made by him in his article
on Bitschl's Plautus. In his first volume he did not admit 11111111 (Glor. 542) : in
hie second we bave opsonabo (Bacch. 97).
