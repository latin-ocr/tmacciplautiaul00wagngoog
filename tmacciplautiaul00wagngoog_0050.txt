of pire and pater. And indeed in Plautus or other poeta we never
find mate and frate = mear andfrater‚ though in 'a Faliscan inscription
we actually read MATEHEOUPA‚ ie. 1111111111 euhat¹. But this
isof course a low dialectic corruption².

In the same way, we have to explain the loss ο1 1 final t and d.
An old form 11111 (instead 11111111) owes its existence to this process
(sec note on v. 170): it was used until the time of Tacitus, if we
may trust the authority ο1 the Medicean MS. In the Aulularia we

have epu (=apat orepud) in several instances (v. 83. 340. 736.)‚ in

the same we should pronounoe

capritanae 422123.
erat = ero 421. ·
111 = 11320. v .
decet = dece 136. (See 111. Graiu, pluat. atad. p. 10).

The preposition ad is thus osten degraded to a simple d, e. g.

ssd tdpostrtmum Poen. 1v 2, 22.
quis sd 11111 111 Amph. rr 2, 1.

11 11111111111111. 1 2, 100.

ut td padca redeam Ptorm. w 3, 43.

But it would'be superfluous to accumulate more instantes of this fact:

we shall only add that even 111 was entirely dispensed with in the rapid
pronunciation of the time of Plautus. Bentley has quoted in his Sche-
diasma (p. xv ed. Lips.) the following instantes:

soleat isse=aole⁹t 1111.

student facere=studt secere.
11111111 despicatu=ltebe⁹ 1111111111.

To these we might easily add other instantes from Plautus, but to
prove the existence 11 such forms aa we assume here in the metres of

¹ See Ritschl‚ corn. inser. lat. 1 89.

² The real explanation oi such forms as pere mare frere is obvious. We hare, oi
course, 1ο go back 1ο patre matre fratre; the t gradually disappeared, as it was
already assimilated in parricida, and 11111 the language had lost all differentes oi
quantity, i. e. when the aecent decided the length or ahortness oi a vowel, the three
words, though originally different, were thrown together under one head and dealt
with after the same lawe. We need not add how dangerous‚ nay how fallacious it
would be to draw inferentes from the Frenoh with regard 1ο the pronunciation oi
Latin. I do not hesitate to accede 1ο Riteohl's assertion ‘omnino tam esse lubricum

hcc genua comparationis arbitror, nihil ut indeprensus (Prota, 1. t).
