0011011111, apat. 1 2, 35 where we have (1001111010 mamis show, as Mr.
Munro says (on Lucr. 1 136), that the idiom is not confined to animi,
and thus strongly speak against Professor Key's hypothesis.

by Asconius on Oic. 1011. 18, 23, although there isno serious founda-
tion 10111, the diuisores being no legally authorised persons, bnt distri-
butore 01 heibery money. See Long‘s note and cic. pro Plancio 19, 48.
We may however remark that the expression 11009101011 cariae is 0011οξ
λεγόμενον, and was doubtless meant as a translation of 111010111υᾶοχηο
’01 the Greek original (see de Aac. p. 15). The whole passage treats 01
Athenian life: distributions 01 money were very frequent at Athens, bnt
almost unknown at Rome before the time 01 the emperors

108. nummus ‘has a different sense in Plautus according 00 11
means Greek or Roman money. As a Roman coin, itis equivalent to
a sestertius (Epist. 11,52. Most. 11 l, 10): in the other case 10 0 drachma
