77 s. Famianus Strada has written a special paper on this littera
7669611116 the right explanation has been found out by Lipsius who
’ compares an epigram of Ausonius (128, 10): aaa, inperite, P putas iii
seriptum, ati locari iota muueait usqum? This epigram is directed
against Eunus, a man of very bad reputa, who, as tho poet insinuatas,
ought to be sent to the gallows. The figure of a long Ι 16 indeed some
what like the appearance of 6 herging body, especially if that body
should be very thin and slender. 166966 litterae are also mentioned
Bet. v 2, 7 and Pacu 1v 2, 15, but without any special reference 6ο the
letter I: comp. littera penulis Pseud. 17 .—uuame is not pleonastic, as
Weise says (see note on v. 563); Staphyla intends making of herself
oue long letter3 i. 6. 6 166661 exhibiting one long stroke.

79. aesinae defaecmo is explained by Camerarius ‘liquido minimeque
turbido, i. e. hilari 3' see Pseud. 760 auae liquet, uuus defaecatumst eor
milei. The same meaning is expressed by ceriaco 1566616 et 6666661151 es
Epid. v l, 36 and liquido ee mainan Pseud 232. In o'ne passage (Most.
158) the word defaecatus is metaphorieally used of a person cleaned by
a bath.

81. 6666666661 ‘in Plautus and Terence the i of 5666 must always
be pronounced as a pure vowel when following uuue,· this shows that
aenaeae is actually one word just as well as etiam quoniam uspiam and
sometimes we find uuaeiam written together in the MSS. (Pria. 195.
Pseud. 546 [Meu. 1155]).’ Brix on Trin. 3.—quippiui‚ instead of
quippeaiis very frequently given hythe best Mss, e. g. Most. 948.

a, in the same way as we have tutia=tuteae: 666 Oorssen, ausspr. 1,
272. The right punctuation of this passage is first seen in Pareus’
edition, and is here of much importance for the construction of the
sentence. The sense is ‘why should Inotl Shall I really take care of
all withint Perhaps you are afraid, somehody should run away with ’
'our housel‘
