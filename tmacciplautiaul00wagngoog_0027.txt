v. 67 we find a ridiculous emendation in J ’s text instead of the
genuine reading preserved in B. The emendator was happier in his
conjecture on v. 81, though he simply did not understand the reading

he found in his archetypa, or else he would not have tried a conjecturs
at all—I should not ascribe the reading found in J v. 141 to emen.
dation: a grammarian who changed aaa into siin another passage

(v. 652), would not be ingenious enough to substitute sis for εἰ qaid
ais: we are, therefore, of opinion that J ’s archetype differed here
from R-But what shall we say 01 the unhappy dexterity ol our
emendator who changed facto, which in his archetype was only a slight
error for factom=fuctam, into sacta, a form which in that passage sins
equally against the metra and the grammar l—v. 253 J has a reading
in its text which seems to be the conjecture of a grammarian3 the
same is added over the line in B.--v. 277the traces of lllMIXTl lll—
were mistaken for MINIX'PUM by the scribes ol B, and instead ol
this aaa aaut we have mixtam inJ and later Mss, which is, how·
ever, against the metra-My note on v. 343 gives two instances of
J’s inferiority to R First, the genuine reading facile was corrected
into facero, because the emendator did not understand the construc-
tion qaod te abstinero posse eorm secondly, the distribution of the verses
is in tha worst confusion, though it is already wrong in B. The
same passage shows the dependency of the later MSS. upon J.—The
strongest proof, however, is v. 241, where J omits a word on account
of the metra: thelina is actually a trochaic septenarius but by some
strange accident it stands now among iambica This tha emendator
tried to remedy by omitting a word which, if it is only for thesense
of the line, may well be omitted¹.

I could easily draw more instances from other lines of the Aulu-
laria or from other plays 3 butas I think the above passages fully
sufficient to show the truth of my assertion, Ileave it to curicus
readers to collect more exemplos for themselves, if they should be
anxious to have them all together. It seeum to me from the instances
given that J is a corrected copy of an archetype which followed almost
