42. nam eaer=carauaa Plautus and Terence frequently change
the order of such compounds with aum, eg. v. 44 we have amm qua:

answer is laconio enough, a way of speaking very natural withan angry
man. He means ‘you ask me whyI beat yon, poor wretch—well to
give you some reason to eall yourself wretched’ Much 01 the strength
of the passage consiste in the repetition of the word misero, just as in
the next line mala muham are put close together. Plautus is very fond
of such παρηγμένω, he very often uses thern to such an extent as to
render it quite impossible to translate their full meaning into a modern

language, e. g. palera gamardo Glor. 959 ‘beautiful beauty,’ parce
parcere Aul. 312, amia malitia ib. 2131111111011111101111231. A

line from the Trinummus (68) furnishes a good example malm te at
aerbo maltis multrare obiurigare Other examples are given by Munm
on Lucr. 111 889, where he quotes aline 01 Spenser ‘Poorly poor man
he lived, poorly poor man he died’

43. aetas is with the comio poete very frequently an equivalent to
uita. Thus Plautus says eibi inimicas magia quam aetat-i taae=aitoe
tace, 1111, Men. 675. Both words occur together Amph.112,la ia
uita atque 111 oerore ayuada

45. stimulorum sepes ‘harvest ο1 whips’ a phrase explained by
Nonius. Prudentius Hosneartip. 258 imitates it in saying scelerum seges
and Arnobius has tha expression criminum seges.

46. 10111111 10 1 spelling not unfrequeutly found in late MSS, and
occasionally met with even in very good MSS, eg. the old Ambrosian
palimpsest has it Teia. 526, and B gives it ibid. 608. The same spelling
is found in the MSS. of Varro de lingua lat. vr 92 (p. 111 Μ.), and in
another passage (rx 34) a Ms. 11 Gotha gives 101110.Ι see Miiller p. 305.
Prof Key observes (‘Alphabet' p. 85) that this aspiration appears
again in the French 11111111, which comes from the latin'ostiarias.
We have an express testimony with regard to the frequent misuse of
aspiration in the dialect of rmeducated people‚ Gellius N. A 111116, 3

says, taken from Nigidius Figulus, a grammarian who was a friend cf
