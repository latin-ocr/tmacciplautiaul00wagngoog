was frequently doubled¹, there being almost no difference between the
pronunciation of a single or a double ι’. Plautus, who wrote ile, had,
therefore, unlimited licence to lengthen the i (ie. ιο assume a slower
and weightier pronunciation of the i as ll) wherever sentence or metra
seemed to require it, or to shorten it, in case the word should not be
ol much importanca In fact, the short pronunciation of the i in iilo
occurs in Plautus in more passagcs⁸ than that quantity in which thie

word always appears since the prowdy ol the Latin language was
entirely reformed and fixed by Ennius’ dactylic poetry.

The superlative circillamue has a startling quantity in a line in the
¹ Aenaria (241),

ptrtilorum simillumae sunt ianuae leuinias.

But if seen under thie point of view, we understand thie seeming
irregularity at once. Plautus himself who wrote sinim was at
entire liberty either ιο say similiurrcac, or in drawing the secent back
on the first syllable to ehem the second, which was the less objection-
able, because the il (according ιο the later spelling) had indeed a very

weak sound⁴.
In the sams way, the word amenitas must be read alitiliies in a line

ol the renuamus (833).

lius Popillius, see Ritschl's note on the lile ol Terence by stemnius, in Reiffer-
sheid’s edition oi the fragments ol Suetonius, p. 512.

¹ In the name Achilles the i appears short in the first line ol the prologus to the

Poenulus :
Achssem Aristtrchi mihi conmentarl lubet.

The spelling actitem stands thus in BG and the short quantity oi the i may bs
defended by a line lrom Plautus’ Mercator (488) lictillem οταιο, ul aarum milri det,
Hector qui experiaris fuit. For this line ses Biicheler, rhein. mus. xv 435. and ou
the whole question M. Graiu, plaut. stad. p. 13. We may compare the two forms
’Δχιλλεύς and Ἀχιλεύς as found in the Homeris songs.

bus.-All those scholare who believe in an entire harmony between the natural and
metrical accent in the versification oi the comio poets cannot of course credit the
short quantity oi the second syllable in simillumae. They will consequently save
the long quantity by pronounoing smillumae. We believe, on the contrary, that in
this one passage the syllable in question was rhythmically shortened, and we may
compare the analogous case ol sigito, which will be mentioned hereatter.
