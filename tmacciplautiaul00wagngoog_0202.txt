· phrase will be found showing that tado facere aliquem, ladam facere
aliquem, ludos dare'ale‘qaem are not Plautian expressions

252. In aptam copiast obeerve the alliteration together with aeso-
nanco. Thornton remarks ‘There is a poor conceit here. Megadorus
had said ludos facias, which may signify you make spart os me, or you
piae a pallio elac, play or spectacla ,· in which latter sense Euclio takes
it and repliee I could aot, {fl would, by reason of his poverty? This
play on the expression used by Megadorus is really so very poor that we
cannot believe it to be intended by Plautus himself, but it seems rather
due to the refinement of the commentatore Euclio very strongly ex·
presses the idea ‘how could so poor a man as I make spart of so rich a
gentleman as you‘l'

254. Itis of course equally correct whether we accent oe‘an illa or
cam ala, but the first pronunciation seems to harmoniae more with the
habit oi Plautus: see Introd. p. exne-comp. Tria. 571 anacteam
