1111111 (1.1. the Greek διάβαθρον) is quoted from Naevius by Varro.

509. colcariae occurs only herc and Gruter 648, 133 orolocimrius
(or moloch.) here and in an inscription Muratori 939, 6. Iam now in-
clined to consider this line as spurious: for, first of all, why should the

ψ solearii be named after the diobotdrooiif and then, how could the poet

name solearii and molocicorii, members of very different professions, in
one aud the same breath'l ,

510. In this line the two professious which mend old garments aro
appropriately mentioned together.

513. uecordi denotas here a great number or multitude, much in the
same way as aecccoto v. 318. Hildyard quotes the following examples
of this use: (111 9, 2. 11, 18. 12, 10. Hor. od. 111 4, 79. See also
Plaut. Glor. 250.-phylocioloc: the importunate creditors waiting for
their money are compared with jailcrs. 'l'he word only hera The
reading of this line and the following is however 1101 quite certain.

514. orcirlooii ‘cabinetmalrera’ Hildyard quotes Cic. off 11 7, 25

519. ‘The public expensos, of which the paymcnt of the army
formed a considerable part, fell of course mostly on the shoulders of the
richer classes which possessed more lauded property: and accordingly
the husband of a rich wife had 10 bear all the taxes laid ou her pro-
perty? Koeploe. See also Varro as quoted in the critical notes The
expression ceo militaro occurs also Poec. v 5, 7, but in a different sense.

Varro de l. l vr 63 p. 97 Μ. Scaliger in his note on tho passage observes
that Plutarch uses the analogous expression ἐκκαθᾶραι λογισμόν; we may
