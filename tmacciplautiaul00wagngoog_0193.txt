my 11011 ,· we may only be allowed to ask for'the arguments which entitle
ns to transfer the laws of English poetry to Greek and Latin metres3
and these Ι cannot find in Prof. Key’s paper.

ordinarily used parenthetieally without influenoing tho construction of
the sentence.

143. Perhaps Ishould have given preference to the reading found
inJ : 0111101110. There is no 100111110111101100001110111000100110, iftaken
in its original nature, would here be entirely out of place. aduentare
would however seem to have lost the sense of a frequentative, if the
reading in Poen. 1111, 58 should be genuine: 1111 10 detulerit (1011110111
Camerarius), tn 10 quaesitum 0110001 addentes 111011, but I am inclined '
to think that Bothe rightly reads seraone quaesitum 0110011100 tuem.
The only other Plautian passage in which the frequentative occurs, is
1100114, 51 <=401 Geppert) qnoniam iam decimus menis 0111011111
prope, and there it may well be explained ‘drawa nearer every day!
In Terence and the other comio writers, aduente is not found, Ennius Ἰ
uses it once 111 its frequentative sense, rall. ed. Vahlen p. 99. “

144.Ι sactum 11010 ‘estnon comica magis formula qnam trans-
laticias humanitatis quod est: cupio tibi fieri quod uis, et quantum in

145. Lambinus first saw that the words liberis procreandis could
'not be explained grammatically and therefore transposed quod 11110011·
pitcmam 00101010 sit. Mn 110 di faxint. Ev. 1110110 procreandis 0010
testatorem. But the same result is obtained by supposing the loss of
two little words, as we have done For the metrical constitution of the
whole passage see 0100 p. nxvn. ,

141. The words 110 di faxint are frequently given 10 Megadorus,
but without any sufficient reason. Megadorus afterwards speaks, as if
he was totally disinclined to take a wife (149 0.); how then could he 00
readily assent 10 his sister‘s proposal which is indeed clearly wordedl
Gruter observes ‘potuit uel ioci causa hoc interfari, tanquam scilicet
etiam liberos procreare liceret ex alia re qnam feminis’ wherenpon Gro.
novius justly replies ‘iocosi sunt qui nodum 010 tollunt, ioco interfari
Megadorum’ There seems to be no doubt that these wenis belong 10
