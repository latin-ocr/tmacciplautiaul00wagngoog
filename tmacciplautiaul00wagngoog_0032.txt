Α. AROHAIO LONG vownls

In its most remote period, the Latin language was overburdened
with long and heavy vowels Some os these archaia long vowels are
occasionally found even in later writers, buta great many of them
appear still in Plautus and his contemporaries. They are, however, of
rare occurrence in Terence, nay, some of them seem to have been
entirely lost in the period between Plautus and Terence. In the fol-
lowing peges, all such lengthened vowels are mentioned as concern
Plautus: but before undertaking their perusal, the reader must be
cautioned against the opinion that Plautus always uses the syllables
mentioned with the same (and no other) quantity ; on the contrary, in
his writings he assumes the greatest liceuce to trent them just as it is
best for the verse. This is, of course,a grean convenience sor the poet,
but sometimes very inconvenient to his reader.

1. In declamion we find the following deviations from the common
usage of the Augintan period:

a in the nom. and voc. sing. of the first deciension was principally
long in old latin, aa it is indeed in Samlrrit and in most cases os the
Greek. That it must have been so, might, ewen in defanlt of other

proelis, have been concluded from the simple fact that the genitive aa·

would be left unaccounted sor, ii it was not for the length of the nom o.
(Ritschl rhein mus. nv 400). But we really find it long in three
lines of the old inscriptions on the sepulchres of the scipine

honos sama uirtusque gloria atque ingenium
terra Puou prognatum Publio Corneli.
quoiel uitet defecit, non honts honore.

(Ritsehl, ibid.) lisy, Biicheler shows (intrhicdersdr caisueto philologia
1863 p. 336 s.) that in all the Saturninus which we have, the nom. and

palit’ (Alphabet p. 146), there being no metricat reason at all, why we should not
admit a dactyl -ύν (prim dni) instead oi the spondae prim dm. Iam afraid that
a general application of this system would reduce Plautian lines to a monotony
which would entirely spoil the charm of conversational liveliness we find in the
comio writers.
