INTRODUC'I'ION. lix

This instance may serve as another pclpable illustration-of the trnth
ef the observation made p. xlvi. with regerd to the clasticity of Plautian
prosody.

We may finally draw the reader's attention to the general fact that
compounds in phich two vowels come together, are always pronounccd
por aynizm in Plautus and Terence, eg. dein deindc¹ proin proinde
detim &orcum scorsum praeoptem decentiori.

G. HIATUS.

In order to complete our sketch of the pronunciation ol Latin es seen
in the comio writers, we must also touch upon a subject which is, how·
ever, one of the most difficnlt points in Plautian criticism, vir. the
hictus. After the vast, but uncritical lebonis os Linge, Ritschl first
gsve some distinct and positive rnles with regard to the admission of
hiatus on the metres of the comic writers, in the xrvth chapter of his
Prolcyomcao, though his views as given there were alternaffls in many
respecta corrected end enlarged by himself.

There is, at least, one point on which no doubt can possibly exist,
and this discriminates Ritschl‘s views from those of former scholare.
We shall quote his own words' ι ‘impeditior cst de hiatu comestionem
