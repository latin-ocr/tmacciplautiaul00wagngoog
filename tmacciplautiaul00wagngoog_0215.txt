410. Ι em now disposed to read with Lambinus and Hare ctat,
perii hercle 096 miser: aperitur mmet, adeat: itis erident how easily
aperit* could be taken for oper-it: the short final syllable of miser would
be allowed in the coemam for ego see Introd. p. xxv.

411. In docuit the final t should be drept, according to Introd p.
xxxia-The moyseto is of course Euclio: see v. 405.

412. Congrio on seeing Euclio issuing from the house had taken to
his heels, and therefore Euclio shouts tene terte ‘stop him, stop him ε’ of ,
w. 705. For the quantity tend terre see Introd. p. xxvn.

413. The treeairi are the tmairi capitoleo whose duty it was to
take care of the prisone and to punish those whom they found trespassing
against the security of the publio ; Asopis. 1 l, 3 Sosia is afraid of being
taken up by the treasiri: qaid sociam emere, ei treeuirt‘ me ia carcerem

conpeyeriatl and Arim1 2, 5 Argyrippus threatens the cruel mother of '

his mistress to give her name to the tresuiri: ibo syo cd taetros, rata
bootes ibi admira cho abac: cdpitie te perdam eqo et filiam. Comp.

at once that in the comic poete quam always must be elidad before ob.
414. Douza proposes qaid? qaod minata'e: and who would hesi-
tate to accept this reading if it were found in the Mssl But the au·

thenticated reading admits of a very appropriate explanation ‘why did .

you threaten mel’ and should therefore not be solicited.

416. uiuere is frequently an equivalent for the simple esee: eg.
Ampe. prol 75 emtores uiuere Trin 390 lepidae aiam ‘you are a
jolly man? Mera 202 alote omia awo-igere mace ibid 908 eye
bano otoo eniam. Catullus has the same use of uicere: 10, 34 redte
inacho mab oc molesta aiath, and 111, 1 cicere caram reiro eod).

417. plue labeaa=lubeatebr‚ as explained by Operarius The usual
way of circumscribing the comparative would be by maye: only one
other instance of plus being known, Nemes. ecl. 4, 72: plue tornea spec
amaa, plue eet formosae Ioles. We may also quote the Italian piet oclea-
ts'em' and the French plue sobmon. Guyet and Weise write moli,
Bothe omits pltea-In labeas the final letters aa should be entirely
dropt: see Introd. p. xxxiv.

419. awllior mageb: to strengthena comparative by adding magia
