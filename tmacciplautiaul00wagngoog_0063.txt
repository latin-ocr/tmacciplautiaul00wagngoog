The second class of our instances of violated quantity will bs divided
into two sections: 1. violation of quantity in vowels naturally long 3
2. violation of quantity in vowels long by position

1. Under this head we have to mention some very strong cases3 but
it may be premised that, in almost every separate instance, some editor
or other tries to remedy such offensive violations of regular quantity
either by transposition or some kind of alteration of the text, ie by
admitting' a kind of criticism which may have its, justification if the
case in question should be quite isolated‚ but which must be entirely
discarded if the multitude of analogous instantes defies correction. We
simply put some instaures together and let them plead for themselves

Thea in an imperfectos the second conjugation is shortened in the
following line:

⁴quid td me ibatis? ridiculum uerebtmini.
Ter. Phorm. v 8, 8}

Bentley might well call this an ‘indigua et talpis licemia,' because·
he was not aware of the general law which accounts ior the shortened θ’.

In Plautus the word Acleraaa generally occurs with a long a, and
therefore, ss Ritschl observes ‘aaa produci dream syllaba dicenda eat la
Acheruns per Plautinas fabulas macac, aad lmspa corripi ia Poeaaha’
(Proll. Tria onxxr). The passages alluded to by Ritschl are: ⁴

ipse abiit td laborantem sine uiatico Poea. prol. 71.
quo ue' orsus a inserente mortuos amessa aaa 1 a, 1³1,
quoduis genus ibi hominum uideas, quasi hohemntem ueneris ibid. 1v 2, 9.

to which Graiu (plaut. stad. p. 16) adds a line from the Mostellaria
(509).

uiuom me scoemunt td laborantem mortui

We have here four instances of a rhythmical shortening of a vowel
which is in all other instances long. That this same vowel isalways
short in the usage of later poeta, is no doubt due to the adoption of the
quantity'of the Greek word ⁸. ,
