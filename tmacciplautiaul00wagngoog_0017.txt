first eight, the other the last twelve comedies¹. As this MS. is the
oldest and best authority for the Aulularia, due care has been taken to
represent its readings with the utmost accuracy. Parcus’ second edition
has therefore been made the basis of our own recension, but his state-
ments about the readings cf the ΜΒ. have been compared with Gruter’s
additions in his revision of Taubmann’s edition⁸, and Parcus' own Ana-
lecta Ploutina which form the seventh volume of Gruter’s Lampas
critica As far as possible, the different corrections which huwe been
