(2) J, a manuscript¹ in the British Museum, formerly belonging to
the King’s Library3 it still bears the marlr 15 O xl with which it is
mentioned in Gasley's ‘Gatalogue of the ¹Manuscripts of the King‘s
Library' (Londou 1734) p. 243. The Ms„ being as yet almost entirely
unknown,I will here give a full account of its present state and its
bearing on Plautian criticism.

The MS. 15 O x1 contains first of ull the raculae qtaestions written
in a hand of the tenth or eleventh century. The first leaf being want-
ing, it commences with 1 4,v aetateque dicae. With folio 30· quite
another hand begins which continues to the end of the Tusculans, fol.

58³5 fol. 58b is left blank, fol. 59· Oicero de iactatione rhetorica begins
written in a hand of the l3th century. Here, each page is divided into
two columns 3 and the same continues in the eretortca od Herennium,
which commences fol. 86⁸. After the words ‘et bic liber aon puram
continet litterar qut restat ta reliquis arcear follows immediately in the
same handvvriting ‘Eat negociis familiarib9 impediet amatis ocium
studio subpeditare poseam9’ etc. It ends fol. 112¹> ‘bec tia adipiscemur
eirdes pceptbnis diligentia consequemur& mentatione, Explicit!

Here the Plautian MS. begins. The general character of the
handwriting is that of the end of the eleventh century, but perhaps it
may be attributed with just as much reason to the commencement of
the twelfth The MS. is in a deplorable condition. In the cornere
of the pages the writing has totally disappeared ; very often it is quite
impossible to read either the commencement or the end of whole lines 3
some leaves, especially the first, are almost entirely destroyed. But
this cau be better seen in the Amphitruo than in the Aulularia, which
has not suffered so much as other parts of the MS. I should have been
inclined to think that the MS. was thus lamentably damaged by the
great fire which destroyed a part of the King’s Library in the year
1733, had it not been for Oasley’s observation ‘laenate suat aliqaafolia
in principio codicis’ and p. 316, where he mentions the damages caused

by the late fire, he expressly states that the MS. was ‘ preserved,' with-

out adding any further observation. Moreover, the different MSS. now
