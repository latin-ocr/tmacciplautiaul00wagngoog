me. Key tells us to prononnce pere in these cases The· possibility of
. such apronunciation isquestioned by Ritschl=(Proll. Trica cnv) whose
words are as follows ‘In quibus (ic. monosyllabis) si etiam poter habiss
tum est, eius rei et rationem et documenta desidero. et omnium minime
ex eo argumentandum esse quod, ut e soror monosyllabum soeur, ita
epate· similiter facturn esse pire dicunt, uel hinc intelligitur quod,
etsi Ι scire quoquc et mtre e scateret muter contracta sunt, tamen haec

latina nec contendit quisquam nec poterit contendere unquam mono·
syllaba fuisse? This is, indeed, the best argument which can be alleged
against Proi Key's way of pronounoing and eontracting Latin words

according to the analogy of the corresponding French forms; but has
it been understood and appreciated by Mr Parryl This scholar accuses
Bitschl of ‘losing sight of the difference in quantity’ between frater
muter and poteri But Ritschl’s argument is entirely based on this
very same differenos Hs means that, if we once begin to remodel
theold pronunciation of the Latin after the French, we must be
prepared to find a contracted pronunciation cf muter and frater just
as well as of potu, all these words being treated alike in French as
mire srdrc pire. But we never meet with muter or suctores mono-
syllables, occ account of tbcir offeram quamuy, and this fact proves
that, as we cannot draw a sound conclusion from mm and frere as

to muter and statu, we cannot consequently rely upon the comparison
