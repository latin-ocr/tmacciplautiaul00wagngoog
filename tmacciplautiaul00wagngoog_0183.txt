uxusurlclt OOMMENTARY. 91

a necessary and organic clement in Latin pcetry, at least 00 faras our
sources permit us to traca back its history 3 still, it was frequently em·
pleycd by 660 oldest poets who kept close to 660 spoken language of the
people, which is always fond of alliteratien3 and even in the best
periods of Latin poetry it was often used as an occasional ornament.
Horace eg. uses it very judiciously 10 0006 passages as delae decas od. 1
1, 2. dulce et (10000000 111 2, 13. dulcedocto1119‚10. dulci distinet
e (10000105, 12 060. See avery good essay on this subject in Lucian
Miiller’s book de re metr. poet. p. 450 ss. and Mr Munro's remarks in
his edition of Lucretius 11 p. 106. For modern languages see Marsh'a
Lectores 00 tle Eeplislv leupaepe (Lond. 1865) p. 393.

53. For examples of the phrase oculos ecfodere ὄφθαλμοῦς ἐξορύσ·

σειν see Aac. 187. Oept.1111,4. 7610463. Ter. Eure. 1v 6, 2, ⁴

where Donatus observes ‘femineae minoe aurit!

54. The phrase puldrorum perum will be not unfrequently met
with in Plautus 3 thus we have it again Aet. 117. .

- 57. Forcellini quotes the expression dipitua tremerem from (1060
de re ruat. 0. 45 and 48, and the equivalent patena dipitua from ana
6. c.1110. cepoe transuersus occurs in two passages of Oicero’s, ed
Aa. x111 20 and Fam. vn 25. 10 660 106600 passage the addition cf the
words quod aiant shows the proverbial character of the expression,
which would however bc perfectly evident even without this 6106 .

59. ‘I’ll send you for a schooling 60 660 gallows’ 76000600. 'Phe
cross shall teach you 60 0606 your eyes for ever, if you cannot keep
them shut for a few momente. .

60. 10 660 MS. B we find here the marginal note ‘dec aecem 70001-
tur,' which is perfectly adaptcd 60 660 situation. . Ι

62. duim (compare v. 236 perduint v. 664) is an archaic subj. pres.
from a crude form ete-3 see Key, L. G. 5 732. 'Phe ending e'm is the
same as seen in edim eelim 0100. Cicero has this form in the formulas
dite perduint pro rege Deiot. 7, 21, and reticeam titt iatum 00006000 dl
inmortales duint Oatil. 19, 22. Τ60 expression 00060 dare which pro·-
perly means ‘to give mere words instead of deeds' commonly 00000100
660 more general 00000 ‘to deceive?

· 63. persentiscat: ‘smell the place out, where the gold is hidden'

66. 10 plurimis Ι have kept the e‘ instead of changing 16 1060 a,
since the best MSS. give it very frequently in 66000 words in which the·
preceding syllable has a 0 00 00 e'. Itis as yet an open questiotl
whether we are entitled to write the superlative ending 00000 uniformly
throughout Plautus ornet.
