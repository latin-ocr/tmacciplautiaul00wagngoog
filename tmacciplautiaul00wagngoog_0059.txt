INTRODUOTION. xliii

== mm does not lengthen the first syllable in the word immo, which
Plautus himself would have spelt into: see Marc. 737, Gaea Ribh Gom..

p. 47. Ter. Ptorm. v 8, 43¹.
nn falls under the same rule, as the following instance shows:

per annonam caram dfxit me natfrm'pater.
Stich. 179.

This is the reading of all the MSS. including the old Ambrosiany
Ritschl hesper aarum annonam, in accordance with a conjecture of
Bothe-As there was in the original pronunciation of the Romans no
differente between mna and nn', wefindthe first-syllable momnis
treated as short in several Plautian passages⁸.

pp does not differ prosodiacally from a single p in the word
Philippus, which in Plautus almost invariably appears with the Greek
accentuation Φίλιππος Phillpns⁴. Probably, the short quantity of the
. second syllable is to be attributed to the influence of the Greek accen-
tuation: see Key, Trans. of the Ph. Soc. 1855, p. 130. See also my

note on Aac. 86.
66 has the metrical walue of a single 6 in the verbosae, which must

often be read 1661 The same reason explains the prosody of dedan
Amph 11. 2, 130⁶, and aicbaatim Stich. 532⁷.

1ο be right, but am unable to substitute a better one. 86 161 as our MSS. are con·
cerned, the spelling inance is generally supported by better authorities than imo.

pus ‘et numquam aliter inuenies apud Plautum quin mediam corripuerit' (ad
Auson. lib. 11 21: see Dawes’ Miscellanea erit. ed. Kidd 1827 p. 154) is not
accurate.

reading of the MSS, the Ambrosian palimpsest not being 16 16 relied upon in this
passage. Iam glad 16 666 that Fleckeisen does not follow Bitschl's conjectures in
