Mera. 834 ss. Psead. 109 s. In Greek, βάκχαι in general means ‘furious
women,’ and the word has the same sense in Plautus, where we should
not always think 01 an allusion 10 110 bocaaalia 00 severely punished by
the senate. We must not therefore nse 1110 passage 10 fix the time
when Plautus wrote the Aulularia—sse verb wqataatwn 10 attested
by N onius and given by our Mss: it is therefore quite preposterous to
write 0000001001, as G. Hermann and Goeller do. The same verb occurs

Ilorcellini here again gives 000100, while Freund rightly 1110 carim I

plural 1001000001, Congrio continues in the simile 01 110 bucellae
just as if in Euclio all the Furies were represented together.

cooks, Euclio most liberally provides them with seiam: 00001110 statibus

0011015, 46. Ι have adopted the original Plautian form 011110 verb
in my text praelibera which also shows the original derivation from

the following passages: Paead. 182. 368. 110105431022. Persa 510.
429. 110111 2, 50. Mea. 802. 979. Glor. 591: in all others we find
praeb. In the Proleqomera p. ov Ritschl makes the general observation
‘praebibere quam Plautus formam solam nouit: nam praebere in nouiciis
tantum libris extat,' and again in the Ind. schol. aest. Bonn. 1854 p. v11
‘praebibere forma constanter usum esse Plautum multa faciunt ut cre·
damus? Since this very form praehiberi is read thus Perea 510, 1101
even the most cautious critic would hesitate to replace it here against
the authority of the MSS, and thus Fleckeisen gives praehiberi Oura 11
2, 19, although the MSS. give praeberi. In the same wey we find in
Plautus the original 101111 debibeo instead 01 debeo. As to the metae,
the forms praebibero and debibere have quite the same value as ii
written praebere and debere: see our general remarks Introd. p. nx and
(immemorem. 2, 181.
