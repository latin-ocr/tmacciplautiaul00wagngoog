. D. SHORTENING OF OTHER LONG ENDINGS.

It will be found that final syllables iu which the vowel was long by
nature were not shortened by the sole influence of the accent, unless
the worda 1ο which they belonged were originally iambs¹. We have
yet to mention that the same shortening process affected even such
endings as would seem to oppose the strongest resistance 1ο every
attempt 1ο shorten them: da 611111 111, and sometimes not only are the
vowels of these endings shortsned, but even the final consonante dropt.
Some instances will servato exemplify this observatiou.‘

1. Thus the ending da appears shortened in booaafcraa myas: ⁴ .

bonu ut aecumst facore, facitis

idrus, toras, lumbrice...
Aul. 620². ,

quid, foras? forts hercle uero

In the 1111 two instances, we giv'e the reading ο1 the MSS. which

Captiua' the accentuation Tyndarum, which in accordance with Riuehl

1 Exceptions tc this rule would be adtuli occidi and iussero. But the first may
be explained lrcm 11111, and 1111111 follows the analogy of the short o of the present.
occidi occurs inan anapaestic line, 1. e. in sao-called ‘free’ matre. frastra (p. xxiii)
is quite isolated.—With regard to the dropping ο1 final consonante, we have 1ο
modity our statement. 1 and m were indeed so frequently dropt that the proscdy
oi the antepenult cannot be considered to limit the extension 11 this licence. But
in all other cases the law given above would apply to the dropping oi final conso·
nanta just as well. Sec our remarks on pater and matu p. xxxiii.

² I quote Taubmann’s note on this passage, simply tc show that his view ol 1111
111111 question was quite correct. ‘Critici posteriores non admisere, quod igno·

rorent soros utrunque syllabam habere breuem: ut liquet uel ex Pcsn. v 5, 4.
