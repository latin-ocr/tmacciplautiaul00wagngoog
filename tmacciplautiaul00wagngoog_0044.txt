Luc. Miller's words (de re m. p. 340) ‘etiam hanc licentiam intendere
christiani, apud quos inueniuntur attenuata finali time diotone praecoce
arce actorque percense!

The imperatives of the fourth conjugation show the same shortening
propensity. Thus we have acal (Persa 30) cdl (Most. 66) redi (Aul. 81.
441. Truc. 12, 106=210 Geppert).

It is not difficult to give more instances of all the cases mentioned,
but I think those given will suffice to convince even the most in·
credulous os the existence os shortened final vowels in the prosody of
the comio poete. Ihave not quoted many instances from Terence, but I
should recommend to the readers of the present pages to peruse Parry's
Introduction to Terence, which is, indeed, a very careful collection of
all the prosodiacal abnormities of Terentian versification, though Mr
Parry explains them in a very different manner. I may state that

Mr Parry generally adopts Prof. Key's views‚ he being the writer
in the ‘Journal of Education' 11 34411111 will be easily ascertained
hy looking into Prof. Key’s prefatory letter to the ‘Alphabet'

(1111 p. o).

We shall now briefly enumerate other verbal endings which appear
short in Plautian prosody contrary to the usage of the Augustan
period

An originally long iwas shortened in the passive infinitive¹, e. g. dart
(Pleas. 11111960. Per. Ad. 311. Plaerm. 261), pult (Aet. 719), loqui
(Bacch. 1104): see Ritsohl Proll. cnxvna Oorssen, auaapr. 1, 341, and
in the pers. act. dect titt steti (Gorsaen, ittet.) adtuli (Aac. 430) oeeiett
(ib. 705⁹).-0 was shortened in the first persons cd apd uold ecio aino
aepd dabo ard cedd (Oorssen 1, 345): in the same way we have iassae
Aul. 439, which may be compared to dixero Hor. Serra. 1 4, 104.
odero Ou. cara 111 11, 35. Other instances of a shortened final o
from later poets are given by L. Mella, cle re metr. p. 336. The
imperative dcto stands as a pyrrhich Bacch. 84, and it seems to have

aditor of the Anthology denies the short quantity of the final i in the perf. in another
