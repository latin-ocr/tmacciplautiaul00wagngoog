111 tna introuuccron 1 have chiefly endeavoured to
give a brief, but clear and sufficient summary of the laws
of Plautian prosody. This seemed the more necessary as
tho results of the investigations of ’ Ritschl and other
German scholare on this subject are either totally unknown
or, at the best, but partially known in this country, and
arc moreorer not easily accessihle to the‘Eugh‘sh stu·
dent, they being scattered through Ritschl’s Plautus and
prooemia, and many volumes of German philological
periodicals.
In concluding this preface, it gives me great pleasure
publicly to achnowledge the manifold obligations which
I owe to Dr. Ernest Adams, who has not only kindly
touched my Enghsh style in many a sore part, but to
whose hints and· suggestions both the Introduction aud .
notes are greatly indehted.
Thus I dismiss my book, though I feel that it stands
in need of much indulgence and forbearance-I venture ἐ
to say wthat it would hc better if I could haro written
it at a place more favourable to philological studies fl.

than Manchester.
