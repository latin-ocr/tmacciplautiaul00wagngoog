occasion to speak of Plautian passages and to emend them. Ritschl,
whose name will be connected with that of Plautus for ever, declares
inhia dedication of the Prolegomena to the Trinummus, that, next to
the great Bentley, he considers Gottfried Hermann (whose pupil he was
at Leipsic) as the sole guida in the emendation of Plautus This
admits, however, of many restrictione. Ritschl does by no means follow
the same principles through his whole Plautus. Many facts which he
did not acknowledge in his Prolegomena, were admitted in tha prefaces
to the different parts of the second and third volumes, some even were
silently given up. What Ritschl now holds as to Plautian prosody ,
etc, is developed in an excellent paper in the ‘varietate museum' vol.
xiv p. 400 ss, and the proofs of his views are partly to be found in the
numerous ‘prooemia' which ho had to write twice every year while
professor at Bonnss In the following sketch‚ Ritschl’s present theorice
have been followed throughout, with the sole exception of our doctrine
of the influenoe of the accent on Latin poetry, where we follow the
views briefly developed by Btckh (bericht dar berliucr adad· der wis-
censet. 1854 p. 270 ss.) and more fully proved by Oorssen in his book
on Latin pronunciation.

But to return to the two passages quoted from Cicera—we need
not dwell upon the fact that for a full appreciation of Plautian mctres
and prosody, we must have ajust idea of the oldest pronunciation of
the Latin. A search after this will not fail to throw much light on the
oldest history of the Latin language 3 it will, at the sarno time, show that

many forms now found in the socalled Romanic languages were already

anticipated in the popular speech of the times of Plautus and Terence. ,

This accounts for the otherwise surprising fact that many of the
youngest forms of the Latin language are either perfectly identical with
the oldest forms or must at least be treced back to the same explanation.
This point is duly appreciated and even somawhat overvalued in a
paper ‘On the metres of Plautus and Terenoe' by Prof. Ray, which is
appended to his trectise on the Alphabet¹.

¹ Prof. Key‘s system of prononncing Latin verses may ba called o contractior
ona, since he malros use of a contracted pronunciation of certain worda even where
matrioal reasons (at least those generally accepted) would well admit the uncon·
tracted forms. E. g. Prof. Kay tells us to read poeto cdmprtm dm adscribend ‹tp-
