minatum ca‘aeqrmda' gradu. Pacuvius v. 37 Ribb. has praegrandi gradu.
The word itself is explained by Nonius as prandemfoccra and examples
are quoted from Varro, Plautus, Lucretius, Accius and Pacuvius. For
the formation of this future and the imperfecte in 66666 instead offeham
see Key, L. G. § 461 and 468. The imperfecte are not only confined
to archaic latinity‚ but occasionally appear even in later poets 3 eg.
we find aeihut in Catullus (68, 85) and 66696666 in Propertius (1 3, 25).
The 6 of the suffixes ebo and eham must have been originally long, and
appears as such in the so-called third and fourth conjugatione, where
-we have the normal forme leq-eham emtarum. But we find like-
wise the future tenses. carry-cho Plaut. aaa, 112, 5. dicabo Ribb.
(tom. p. 216 and firi-eho ibid. The e was afterwards affected by the
same shortening process which so many endings in the Latin language
had to undergo, and after it was shortened‚ it could be contracted in
666 verbs of the first and second conjugation, where we have amam
..cmo-ttom amatam and acerram doce-thom doce-bom. The same was
no doubt beginning tc work in the fourth conjugation, where ammom
was transformed into (mutatam) audibam and the original mactato ,
into aad-tho. But there the shorteiring process was never entirely
worked out and the original quantity always remained pradominant-
This is, at least, my view of the matter ; but I shall not neglect to
advisa my readers to compare the different wiews developed by Oomsen,
vam. beia. aar lut. semmai. p. cae-541, and Key‚ L. G. § 466, note †.
With testudinata produc ‘tortoisepaoe’ we may compare formicinus
prodas Men. 888.

50. The nominative diui= di occurs only here in Plautus 3 but the
formula diuum otqm horniuamfldem is repeatedly found, Amph. v l, 69.
Aul. 297. Mero. 842. aad. prol. 9.-6666666 is said by Nonius to be
the same as adigam, an explanation which rendere only 666 general
senae of the word, but does not account for its formation. This is ex·
plained by Festus’ remark (u. exitiosi) ‘uait antiquos diam pro
aperit mamffesmm eat! caim is formed in the same way as sarim, for
>which see Key, L. G. §568 A third formation cf the same kind is
capsim capric, which was already misunderstood for cape aia (si ais) by
Cicero Or. 6 154. Tha perfecte axi (oy-ai), soci (soc-aa), capsi follow
666 analogy of dumi (dac-ai) rep-ri etc, while ayt fici cepi lengthen the
radica] vowel. See Oorssen, krit. beitr. mr iat. forment. p. 530.

52. Such alliterations as scelesta eolo aecum are very frequently
found in the ancient Roman poets and deserwe our especial attention.
