’ vs 67 we find a ridiculous emendation in J 's text instead 01 the
genuine reading preserved in Β. The emendator was happier 111 his
conjecture on v. 81, though he simply did not understand the reading
he found in his archetype, 01 0100 he would not have tried a conjecture
at all—I should not ascribe the reading found in J v. 141 to emen-
dation: a grammarian who changed 010 into 01 in another passage
(v. 652), would not be ingenious enough to substitute 110 101 si qaid
0101 110 ara, therefore, 01 opinion 11101 J's archetype differed here
11011 B.—But what shall we say 01 tho unhappy dexten'ty of our
emendator who changed facto, which in his archetype was only a slight
error for fact0m=foctam, into foeta, a form which in that passage sins
equally against the metre and the grammar l—v. 253 J has a reading
in its text which seems to be the conjecture 01 a grammarian 3 the
00111010 added over the line in B.-v. 111 the traces 01 ΙΝΜΙΧΤέ tl
were 1110101101101 MINIXTUM by the scribes 01 Β, and instead 01
this 000 aaut wc have mixtam in J and later MSS, which is, how·
ever, against the metra—My note on v. 343 gives two instanccs 01
J ’s inferiority 10 Β. First, the genuino reading focale was corrected
into facere, because the emendator did not understand the construc-
tion qaod te abstinere posse scia· secondly, the distribution 01 tho verses
is in the 'worst 0011110101, though it is already wrong in R The
same passage shows the dependency 01 the later MSS. upon J.-The
strongest proof, however, is v. 241, where J omits a word on account
01 the metro: the line is actually a trochaic septenarius, but by some
strange accident it stands now among iambica This the emendator
tried to] remedy by omitting a word which, if it 10 only 101 the 001100
011110 line, may well be omitted¹.

I could· easily draw more instances from other linas 01 the Aula*
laria 01 from other plays, but as Ι think tha above passages fully
sufficient to show the truth 01 my assertion, I leave it 10 curioni
readers to collect 111010 examples 101 themselves, if they should be
anxious to have them all together. It seems 10 me from 1110 1101011000
