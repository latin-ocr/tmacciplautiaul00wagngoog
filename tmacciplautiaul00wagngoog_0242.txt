150 EXEGETIOAL COMMENTARY.

730. Throughout the following passage the joke consiste in the
regular misunderstanding of the fem. pronouns, which Euclio refers to his
6616, while Lyconides thinks he speaks of his daughter—For fait see
Intr0d.p.x1n

7³1. The expression culpem conrardum justifies Brix’s correction
of v. 728. Oomp. captu 3, 43 (=400).

733. 1666666 is very frequently used in the sense 61 eorrumpere
filiam, ag. Hor. 6666612, 54 matronam nullom 696 16696. Thus we
have 166116 v. 737 with the same ambiguity. (lomp. a similar passage
Pseud. 120 and 121 and the examples given by Westerhov on Ter.
Ean. 113, 81.

7 34. ‘factam infectam fieri 666 potcst' is a principle 61 common
sense and was therefore received among the maxims 61 Roman law.
Oomp. Tryphonius l. 12 ξ 2 D. de captiuis (49, 15) ‘facti 666666 infactas
66116 666111611666 fleri poseant) Pomponius 121). derescind uand.
(18, 5) ‘potest 61666 res iateyro est, conuentione nostro infhetoficri 666116...
post pretium 66161666 infectam 6611666666 facere 666 possumus? We
have the same phrase Ter. lerm. v 9, 44 s. and Plaut. Tmo. 1v 2, 17.

736. ‘Neruum adpellamus ferreum uinculum quo pedes inpediun-
tur? Festus. (lomp. Cure. v3, 11. The instrument was about the
same as the ‘ stocks’ formerly in use in Englnnd.—Acidalius reads 6116
me and seems therefore to take acroasin the more general sense of
‘prison’ which it sometimes has in Plautus (see Parry on Ter. Phorm 11
2,11).

738. (lomp. Tenrld. 1114, 24 6666661666 aanor 616666 odoles-
666116, where Westerhov quotes Ovid, Amor. 1 6, 59 66661 amor ainum-

qac 61111 6616661116 66661661. See 788.

740. The construction itself shows that we should write 611 instead
of 661, though the indicative is given by all our MSS. We may com·
pare another Plautian passage, Mero. v 4, 24 a (= 985 R.) 6666 si 16166
166 611, 6666616 661616 scortari patres, Vbi 1661616166 samma puplica?
where all the MSS. and old editions give est, but Ritschl justly writes
sit. Ι ought to have done the same in the present line of the Aulularia
611 would then have its original long quantity: see p. xm

741. In this line we are indebted to Nonius for preserving the
genuine phrase 1661 clero, which is generally obliterated in our MSS.
(lomp. Ter. Ad. v 3, 55 cum prinae 1661, where the Bembinus has primo
1666 and 661666 latae is found 16 recent MSS. (see Bentley's note): Dona·
tus, whose notes are here interpolated, has however a genuine remark on
this passage ‘ueteres 6666661166 genere (11661661 lacem.’—Plaut 0161. Π l,
48 B gives quom primo 1661 and the MSS. of Nonius give the same
phrase in a line· of Atta 468, 32 = Ribb. com. p. 138. Β61 16 Cic. off.
