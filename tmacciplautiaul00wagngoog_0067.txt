nBoth instanccs heve been altered by Fleckeisen and Ritechl, but the
reading ottho MSS. is defended by Geppert‚ lot. aueepr. p. 93 (Oorssen,
umepr. 2, 115).
· ego <intenderem :: certo scio τε quo picto :2 parce sodes.
Ter. Phorm. v 3, 10.

dedistine hoo tacto ei gltdium qui se occideret.
Trin. 129.

Prot. Key in his ‘Miscellanecus Remarks 011 Ritechl’s Plautus? p.
195, juetly observes that this pronunciation of dedisti (deitati, desti),
dedistis and other derivatione geve riso to the contracted forms of this
verb which we find in Italian (desti deete diere), Spanish (dicte dictor
diersa diere didere), and Portugnese (diste distes dero disee). stilti
must differ from Prot Key when he applies the same contracted pro-
nunciation to the verses of the ancient comio poete themselves: it may
here be repeated for the laet time that the application of late and
modern forms to an entirely distant period seems to violate the lawe of
historicel philology3 we may therefore justly recogniee the working
power and the first germs of Romanic forms in the shortened forms of
Plautian prosody‚ but we must not use the final effect of any historical
development for the explanation of the remote cause which first
originated it What would be the result if we were to explain Angla-

Sexon forms from modern English corruptionell
