INTRODUOTION. v

corrected copy of a very faulty archetype. Whether this presumption
bo true ornet, we shall soon have ιο decide

The last page os the Mais filled with an extract on the critical
signs used by the ancient grammarians taken from Isidor (Orig. 1 20) ¹,
but without any indication os its source It is written in the same
handwriting as the preceding Plautian comedies.

Before entering into a detailed discussion os the critical valua of
this MS, Ι have to says few words as to its general orthography.
Generally speaking, it is much inferior ιο Β in this respect: almost all
the old spellings we find in B, are modernised in J. Our commentary
will show that such forms as thesaurus adolescere coarmatus surripio
surripui sumptum oum etc. are much more frequent in Jthan oure
caumes addesoous etc. as found in B. Nevertheless‚ not a lew traces of

older andibetter spellings are left, e g. aput optigit opturet (302) coruos
’ οιο. Ι may confidently state that I have tried to be as caretis] as
possible with regard ιο these minutiae, and I hope that nothing has

escaped my eyes, the MS. having beon collated by myselt' twice over
and inspected again wherever a doubt arose. But thera is one point in
which this MS. differs essentially from B: via its treatment of caelitics
and proditiose. Ipresume that this is a point very often neglected by
manuscriptcollators, although it seems to have a just claim upon our .
attention, as being an undoubted relic of antiquity which we ought to
notice, ifnot to preserve. Ritschl has a few lines about it, Preti. Prior.
cxv, where he mentions

opse=ob ee, Trin. 79.
apstirpe=ab stirpe, ibid 217.

both found in B. I may add that it is not difficult to collect many other
instances of such spellings from Ritschl's critical commentmy, e. g.

apste=obe te, Persa 50 (B)

adammwd imaum, Glor. 361 (Β)

appatrem=ed ροινοοο, Mero. 962 (0)

commeruerat mmrus, Pera 450 (BOD ‘qaod obscurare
uolat’ Ritschl)
