114 nxuunulouu COMMENTARY.

10 quito groundless. Ligellum, as Nouius reads, would be a diminutive
from liguum, and would, of course, give 0110 same sense, but occurs no
where else. Most of the commentators take, however, de 000 regello in
the sense of ‘from his house’ or as Hildyard says, ‘through tho msters
os his house! Aa there is uo other passage in any author, where siqu
lum would have 0110 sense domicilium breue, I prefer tho explanation

given by Parcus according to which we need not invent a new sense for
⁹ this passage. Euclio thinks that he is undone, when the smallest pieoe
of wood is bumed in his house, and 110 therefore keeps no wood in the
house: see v. 355.

300. ‘Some commentatore suppose, by follem ismeant a purae, but
tha plain and obvious sense of this word appears to be a kind of loy,
which Strobilus supposes Euclio to fasten to his mouth and throat to
catch his breath in, while he is asleep. The thought is extravagant,
but humorous.’ 1201110011.

302. guttur is masculine in another Plautian passage, Glor. 835.
Novius too has usqrcc ad imum patrarem v. 118 Ribb.

304. ‘ Innuit neutri ab altero esse credendum' Acidaliae.

305. Tho words ot acio etium quomodo simply form a connexion
between the preceding johas and those that follow. This same phrase
is generally used to express threats, and thus we have it v. 47: see
Weise's note on Poeni 2, 165 ; but it occurs in the same way aa hers
in another passage, Poera 1 3, aa-For the hiatus in this 11110 see Introd.

300. See Introd. p. x.-plorot ‘he ories his eyes out;’ for the
infin. comp. Hor. od. 111 10, 4. Aristophanes has a similar johe
about a mean Athenian, Patrocles, Plut. 84 ἐκ Πατροκλέους ἔρχομαι,
ὃς οὐκ ἐλούσατ’ ἐξ ὅτουπερ ἐγένετο. This however means that Patro
cles never took a bath since his birth, because he was too mean to pay
for it.

307. pote alono stands not only for potes (0. g. Τ1111.352) andpotest,
but even for posse. See Ritschl,Proll.crc1.—For the socalled ‘great‘
taleut, see Smith’s Dictionary of Antiquities s. v, Talentum&

311. praesegmina, ἀπονυχίσματο ‘ parings‘
