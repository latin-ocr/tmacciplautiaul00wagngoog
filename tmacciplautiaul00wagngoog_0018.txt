ii INTRODUGTION.

way of a slight letter-change¹. The orthography of this MS. hasbeen
adopted throughout, though modified with adue regard to manifest
errors which must be attributed to the period when it was written.
Pareus is generally pretty accurate in - this respect, though he is not to
be trusted throughout Ritschl warns us in the preface to his first
edition of the Bacchides to draw conclusions from Pareus’ silence, and
Ihave endeavoured to observo this restriction, though there are several
passages where Ι found it impossible to ascertain the actual reading
of the MS.; in such cases I always quote the authority which is
responsible for the reading adopted in my text. Gruter, in his preface
to Taubmanu’s third edition, p. xiv, enumerates the following words
which Parcus generally spells against the custom of his time: corworo
prorsas heras ltere plurima pessimus efficio efflictum succenseo sexcenta
amul heri surreptam fidicine tibicina thesaurus aeto, spelt in Pareus’

edition conripere prorsas erus era plemma pessumus oficio ecflictum
stuaaseo sescenta sensui eri subruptum fldieeuo tibicene thensaurus uoto,
and Gruter charges Parcus with adopting these forms in his text even

where others actually occur in the MS. Now, it appears at once that
almost all thess forms are actually older and more genuine than those
patronised byGrute1·,and in not a few passages our commentary will
show that Pareus expressly states his deviation from the MS. As to
the omissione with which Pareus is charged by Gruter, a careful com-
parison has convinced us that, for the most part, they are perfectly
groundless. There are, as far as we can prove, only two words in tho

list given by Gruter, which Parcus seems to spell against tho authority

of the MS, viz. fldiceaa and tibiceno. Ritschl’s apparatus gives the spell-
ing fidicinas in B Most. 960, and iu ABG Stich. 380, tibicine is found
in the Stichus, tibicinam in the Mostellaria and Pseudulus. Parcus has
fiducita et libicene Stich. 1v l, 36 (=542 Ritschl), but Ritschl expressly
states fidicina et tibicineto be the spelling of the MSS. Nevertheless, the
present edition of ths Aulularia gives the word always with an e in the
penult, because Pareus has the following note on 11 4, 2 ‘Tibice-
nosqae] Sic V. Ο. dr Pal. sext. at τὰ qae non est in V. 03, and accord·

unius certae normae lege generatim censendas, sed singulis in locis sola ratione disce
aestimandas. Ritschl, praet. Mil. glor. xx.
