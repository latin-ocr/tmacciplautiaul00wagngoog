125. Lambinus’ note on this line is well worth preserving. ‘Ego
tamen: he says, ‘qui cum haec scriberem, annum aetatis agebam m,
duas mutas mulieres uidi' This provokes old Taubmann’s fun, who sor
his part assuras Lambinus, that at an age of 29 10 knew already more
than two dumb women-Ben J onson (Stant Womam 5) calls a woman's
silence ‘a wealthy dowry.’

127. Adelphasium uses almost the same words Poea.12, 28 itast:
aarum 100 atnam lamia coyc'tcito.

130. Α construction masere elect does not exist. The passage
quoted byForcellini,1'rac. 1v 1, 12 (ε 698 Geppert) proves nothing:
the MSS. ΒΟ give qaia eil 10100000000010000 awai 0011100ιηὶ0, but
the MSS. used by Lambinus read mmsis me (monuit ematis without
mili is tho reading found in 0 MS. at Paris collated by Geppert). It is
therefore clear enough that in this line the datives depend on 0000001000
and wwaere follows its analogy.

131. mussare is explained by Nonius 427, 15 ‘hominum oeedte
quid et prtem uoeeloqeentiemff The frequentative mussitare (0. g. 00010
mussitant (ias. 1115, 33) is explained by Donatus on Ter. Ad. 11 1, 53
‘ proprie cot dissimulandi caasa tacere, dictum uel a muto uel ab M, quae
littera eat nimiam praece accis ac pacate nullius, adeo at cola oratiam,
0000 inter 0000100 imulerit, atteratur capae aubwdat' Oomp. the English
to mutter and see Munro on Lucr. vr 1179. “

133. For forato see Introd. p. xxxva Though it appearstous strange
that a confidential conversation should purpoaely take placeio a public
street, we should not forget that the constant habit of the Roman
,comedy compelled the poeta tolet all such things pass in the streete as
would otherwise require a more appropriate scenery. Oomp. Pompon.

134. As the metra shows that a syllable is wanting in the reading

given of this line by the MSS. (for a hiatus between rem and eye is
perfectly impossible), Ι had venttned to write 0001000000, 101 think
now to havea better conjecture to substitute to such an unhappy de·
pravation of the text as this would be. I should now write atti tuam

rem eqo ticam bic loquertrfcwat'lidrem.

135. fhmiaa] For the long quantity of the voc. ·a see Introd. p.
sivla-quio east] ‘quio and quem in old writers are sometimes feminina'
Key, 1. (1.1 310. Seev. 168. Instances of this usage are collected by
Nonius 197, 30 ss—For the separation of aum from quio, see note on
v. 42.
