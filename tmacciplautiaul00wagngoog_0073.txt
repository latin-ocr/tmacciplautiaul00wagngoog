similar contractsd pronunciation of aaa and aa, which is not unfre-
quently met with in the tregia posta

The word maie was treated much in the same way as deam we have
therefore mei swas meo mma meas meib sometimes as monosyllables‚ and
nmmum omarum us disyllables ¹. The real pronunciation of these forms-
in such cases may be ascertained from the spelling micis (= meis) which
occurs in the dactylis inscription on the sepulchre of ons of the Scipios:
this snables us to guess that it was probably very much like the modern
Greek pronunciation of θιός (= decis), ie myis dyo, dre

Many forms of the prououns is and idem fall under the same head 3
thus we have e'o e‘e eodem amm ecia ξᾱεᾱεηι ios medem ὥσ Mem ὦ
eidem (abl.) ibrum The subjunctives summ cilis appear as disyllables
according to tho same rule, and in escendam (Aul. 40) we notice the
sams pronunciation.

The forms aas ei isias (baio) quoius quoi desarve special notice.
0f these, quoi and huic are always 'monosyllablea while the others
admit oi a triple pronunciation:

trocheo, pyrrhich, monosyllable, ,

, eiua iies⁸ ommis

bueus* hiias' iuffis=liais⁴
eiius quomis=quoia⁵

et 'id

¹ For the forms dius and miris see Ritechl‚ de decl. quadum lut. recensi. 1 p. 22.

, ² I purpossly do not mention the oldest forms etue ho-i-as qao-tas (tit. Scip.
Bari. Ritsclil. pr. i. m. ep. t. 37), since they are not found in Plautus and Terence.

⁸ To this head we may refer the examples quoted above p. xlviii. See Lach-
mamn' comm. Lacr. p. 27. and especially p. 160 s.

‘The spelling iuis occurs in an inscription in Gruter's collection 44, 3: sse
Censen, trit. beitr. zur lut. formem. p. 545. In Guyst's edition oi Plautus the
forme eie buis and quoia are several times found in the text.

⁵ This pronunciation must be assumed ior a lineos Lucilius: quoius eoba uc
socie, ludo ac amenitas metris. (Lachmann, l. l.) Lachmann shows that this form
left its traces in cuicuimodi i.s. pacisquoismodi the dropping oi the finale taking
place ae explained above p. mi. The u disappeared much in the samewayas napis
presupposes an original mupius (Corseas, umepr. 2192). The oldest MS. gives
semicorrecti in (lio. Verr. v 41, 107 which Halm is inclined to believe genuine.
⁸ It is quite the sams with rii, rii, ri (πῶς apsi apli *spi (εῳΐι) iso. Sea
note on Aul. 607.
