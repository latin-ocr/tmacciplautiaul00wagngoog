xxxviii INTRODUO'HON.

st tu ad legionem bellator eltae, at in culina ego. ,
Truc. 11 7, 54 (=604 G.)

Another instance of the same kindis babbsAul. 185 and Pseud 161.

5. In the same way the ending ia in the dative and ablativo plural
of nouns and in the present of verbs is occasionally shortened:

' ’ Ter. Eum prol. 9.

quos penes mei fait potestas, bonis meis quid toret et meae uitae
Trin. 8221.

Ennius (ed. Vahlen p. 96, Ribb. Ἕκας. p. 15.)

Bacch. 1095 .

at pbl ego abs te concessero z: iamne tbnr bene ambuhttc
Persa 50.

peregre quoniam aduenis, cena datur.
rmo.1a,as(=1aaa.)
The last instance should be explained from the simple form acam,
which would, of course, fall under the general rula
A very strong instance of a shortened final syllable occurs in the
Bacchides (48):

poteris agere : atque is dum ueniat, abdens ibi oppertbera.

For even if we allow that an a before ane disappears in many
instances, the long quantity of the cwould still remainnnaltered: yet
we must here admit a short pronunciation of the syllable erae. Ritschl
changes the reading of the Mas. by transposing atquc ibi sedens, dam is
aaamt, oppetiere. Fleckeisen is true to the authority of the MSS.

All these short quantities are, of course, of but occasional occur-
rence 3 but they suffice to show the large extension of a very dangeroua
propensity of the Latin lauguage in Plautus' time, which was fast

¹ aaa andraeae should be pronounced as monosyllables.
¹ This is the reading ot the Mas. adhered to in Fleckeisen’s edition.
