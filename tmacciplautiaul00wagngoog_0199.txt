EXEGETICAL COMMENTARY. 107

1v 3, 54. Plaut Epist. in fine: bic 1011011011 qui libertatem malitia
taceat aaa. Cicero too has the word in this sense, adata 11126.-

Instead 01 omni, Cicero would have preferred ullu: see Parry’s note 011 “

Ter. Andr. 113, ll.—siae omrai malitiaat Trin. 338.

pridem csse arbitror: 1111ιὲ11090, and see Introd. p, xx.—aaram baio olet]
We think the following extract from Prof. Key's paper ‘on the word
Iukliuy' not out of place here. ‘A faint suspicion about anything lan-
guage is apt to represent under a figure borrowed from the sense 01
small. Thus subolet mibi is th'e favourite mode 01 expressing this idea
with Plautus and Terence [oboluit haic marsuppium Men 384} The
medium by which the scentia conveyed is of course the air, and thus we
have the phrase ‘ to wind‚' meaning ‘to catch a scent 01 anythiug,' so
also ‘to get wind of,' or as the Germana say wind (1000111101σηῖ

215. For the prolepsis see note on v. 440.

216. Formulas 01 this lrind were usual on such occasions as this:
see v. 780.

218. sadaca fucere] Plautus makes frequent use 01 the socalled
fiyuro 'etyraoloyica eg. this very phrase occurs again Caro. 1 1, 24.
Cicero too has it, de fin. 11 29, 95, most probably in consequence of a re·
membraneo from some poet Oomp. Tria. 446. 599.

219. ‘A poor man, who never gave offense to you or yours,’
(Tlroratoa). For aba see Key, L G. ξ 1303 0, andnote on v. 184.

220. For the construction curari ut Brix on Oapt. 419 quotes the
following passages: Oapt 419. 110. apid. v 2, 47. Το1. dordr. 15, 46.
(lic. de or. 154, 232. Liv. 111. ll.

225. item never has the sense attributed to it by Hildyard ‘ on the
other hand,’ and the passage quoted by him (aaz. prol. 20) very well
admits 01 the common sense 01 the word. Ι have therefore adopted
Brix’s emendation 01 this passage—Forsirctiocum see note on v. 165. ‚

226. locassim is explained by 00111011, ousspr. 2, 37. It arises
from an original form looauesa‘m (from which the common form locauerfm
is derived with the change 01 an s into an r); by a compression 01 the
middle syllables we get locasim or locassim (comp. caasa causac and
Introd. p. 1111). In a similar way we have crasso: arando araso (Key,
1. G. ξ thil-locare is frequently used by the comio poots where later
writers would have said conlocare: sce the examples given by Bentley
in his note 011 Ter. Phorm. v 1, 32.

228. The words onus onustus camare are in thebest 1188110-
quently spelt with an initial 11. Ρ101 Key (‘Alphabet’ p. 68) connects
bonor and (blesus as being of the same origin, both being derived from
a root 11011, denoting a 101111 or 0110190, which is either an 1101101 or a bur·
