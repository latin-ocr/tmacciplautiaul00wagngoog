EXEGETlGAL GOMMENTARY. 145

640. How kindly (6666966) you allow me to feel everywhere!

643. 6 is the genuine spelling of the interjection, not ab, as we
learn from the best MSS.

645. How little constant the langnage in Plautus' time was with
regard to the distinct use of deponent and active forms, we sce here in a
striking instance: 643 ve have 66666666, 645 perscrutatas ee, but 649
perscrutati.

646. peaes is rarely placed efter the word which it governs: see
Key‚ L. G. 5 1349 where Ter. Her. 1v 1, 20 is quoted. Such an artificial
collocation however as we have herois in Plautus quite isolatcd. Oorssen,
auaspr. 2, 297 connects this proposition with penu pacatas penitas, and
says that it originally meant ‘in the storeroom'

648. mittereac Brix on Gapt. 36 rightly observes, has in 666 la·

tinity before (licere frequently the sense of dimittere-It would be pos·
sible, though not necessary, to write binc 6666666.

651. For 6666666666 :accisas see Nonius as quoted in the crit. notes.
—iaterstrinyam: see Key‚ L. G. ς 1342, 1 e.

652. Here compares a similar passage Oua 11 4, 23 abin hisco ab
6661666

653. emortuos ‘completely dead:' Key‚ L. G. ξ 13323.

654. For 666 hiatus 61666 66- see Introd. p. nxnn

657. The syllables forie crepa form a proceleusmatic: see Introd.
p. xxm. For 666 matter see the commentatore on Ter. Andr. 1v 1, 59
andAcl113, 11. ·

658. Α more correct reading would be 666 epo od ianuam conoes-
sero. Itis obvious to understand this of Megadorus' house, near whose
door the slave hides himself

659. Charisius takes Fide as a genitive, as appears from the passage
quoted in the crit. notes: it seems however much more natural to take
itas adative (Key‚ Ia G. § 966). In the same way wc have Fide 667.

660. For the explanation of 666 phrase os alicui mattarum (‘to
deceive, to cheat’) see Nonius as quoted in the crit. notes Gronovius
observes that this ludicrous practice is mentioned by Virgil, nez. V122
(Aegle) soapuiaea's frontem moris 66 66666666 pingit, and by Petronius
Sar. 22 (p. 23 Biich.) 6666 4666166666 somnum laberetur, illa...aoeillo
totam faeiem eiua fialipa'oe leupo persa-abad 66 aon sentientis labro 6666·
rosque sopiti carbonibus pinxit. Gronovius quotes the following instantes
of this phrase in Plautus: Glor.115,4l. More. 114, 17. Ospa 111 4,
raa-For poeaissume see note on 463.

662. illam coruom 661 ras acciat uelim is a well known construction

instead of ille coruos ad mc 666666 aelim.
663. illio :ulica see Mea. 304. 828. 842 in Ritschl's edition. ι
