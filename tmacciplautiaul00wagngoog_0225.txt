Such a hypothesis would not, however, be supported by any historical
documenta

563. paleramat is of course ironical: but there seems to exist
no other passage with the same turn 11 expression-Of the particle
praequam I cannot find more than five instanccs in Plautus: this line,
Mero. 23. Most. 982. 1146 and Aaiph. 112, 3 ; it does not occur in
Terence aud the fragments ol the other comic writers, but in later
times Gellius uses it egain xvr l. In the same wey Plautus has the
particle 11111111 Amph. 1 1, 218. Mea. 376. 935. (111126. Bacch. 929.
11111476. Ritschl end Fleckeisen write prae 1111111111 two words, and
should consequently also write prae 111 which they do not.

504. Ou the hiatus in this line, see Introd. p. ax11.—Theword
linarias occurs only here in Plautus, but is also quoted irom an inscrip
tion, Gruter p. 649, 3.

565. caupones ‘retaildeelera' ‘pelagium’ est quod ad 1111111111
1111111111 assai solet, qaae et patayiata (Epid. 11 2, 47) dicitur, et‘pata·

however a ἅπ. hry.—Our MSS. give here 1111111111, and iadauiatam
Epid. 11 2, 471 but Varro derives the word from· 1111111 de l. l. v 131 p.
51 M. aud accordingly writes interium, and from this source Nonius
derives his knowledge p. 539, 31 ‘irrisorium 1111111111111111111, qaod corpori

1111111111 11 intlaesam (thus the Mes). The adjective induciatus occurs'
in Appuleius and the verb induciare in Martianus Capella. On the ia-
dasiaaa itself, Bottiger (Sabina 2,113 sec. ed.) has the following remarks.
‘The shirt was 1 kind 11 under-tunic (1111111111) made either 11 lineu

by both sexes: 111· men it was called miscela for women iatasiawa
(Ferret. de re uest. 3, 1 p. 175), precisely 11 the English distinguish
between 11111 and shift. The negligo or morning-dress 11 ladies in-
doors consisted, aa we see from many passages in Ovid and Prope1tius, in
nothing but such a shirt which when fitting very tightly, did not even
require to he fastened by a holt. . but as it might easily become very
troublesome on account of its length, it was generally kept together hy
1111111111, at least until the proper tunica was thrown over it.’

506. 1111111111 occurs only here: aeraria stands in the MSS. 6111.
