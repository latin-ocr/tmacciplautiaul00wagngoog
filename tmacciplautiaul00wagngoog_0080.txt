INTRODUOFION.

ADDENDA.

Long aiter the text and nearly the whole Introduction vere printed,
the editor was by the kindness of Prof. Fleckeisen at Dresden enabled Ι
ιο give m os wadingo of ne ns. narn trae seges manns
accuraoy which is indispensably necessary for all critical purpcscs·
Although all possible care had been taken to find out thc actual
readings cl B, it was in more than one instance impossible to arrivs at
the positive truth. All such doubts have now vanished, since by means
of the following addenda to the critical commentary it vill be easy
enough to ascertain the reading of the MSS. in each single instance.
While I have to thanlr Prcf. Fleckeisen for this valuable contributicn
to the critical part of the present work,I must excuse myself to my
readers for the inconvenience necessarily arising from this lats addition
to the critical notes. But I may presumo that for many of them it
will be nc very serious inconvenience, since the passages which must bc
altered in consequence of our better knowledge of the MS, are not
above two cr three, and are moreover all pointed out in the exegetical
commentary: those readers who would really study the critical notes,
vill, Ι hope, kindly overlook a slight inconvenience and rather rejoice
at having an accurate knowledge of the most important authority for
the text os tho Aulularia ¹.

Tho collation thus liberally placed at my service was made by
Mr A. Schwarzmann, during his sojourn at Rome, 1835. Itis written

in a very neat and clear hand on the margins of the Amsterdam edition,
a 1721. (See Fleckeisen, ep. crit v). In using the following ad-
ditions, it should be obscrved that unless there is an express remark

to the contrary, the statements contained in the critical commentar-y
must be considered right 3 but in any other case all statements given in
the ‘Addcnda' are more authentic than thc former. I have moreovcr

carefully indicated where my statements rest on Schwarrmann’s silence,
ie. where hc adds nothing 1ο the reading found in the edition used by

¹ 1 may add that the final cause cf this inconvenience rests with the post which
lost a letter from Prot. Fleckeisen to the author at the end of August 1865.
