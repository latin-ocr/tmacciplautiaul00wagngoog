contained in this volume seem to bave been already thrown together in
Oasley’s time, though the present splendid binding bears the date os the
year 1757. As regards the age of the MS.‚I may add that Bentley
attributes it to the tenth century, but there he is undoubtedly wrong.
That Bentley knew the MS, was very probable‚ since he was ‘Library

keeper to His Majesty¹’ and his studies on the ancient comio writers

gave him ample opportunity of consulting such a curicus MS. Ι have,
therefore, no doubt that Bentley means our MS. when, speaking in bis
note on Ter. Haut tim. 1 1, 20 about the line in the Aulularia which
in the present edition is 241, but which in the MSS. stands after v. 390‘
(=118, 23), he says, ‘Propere a pluribus Oodd abaetat a Regio 800
aaaorana Lege: Nimirum occidor, ni intro huc propero cdrrere? The
word in question is actually omitted in J (a fact of which we shall have
to speak presently) and there neither is nor was any other MS. of Plautus
in the King’s Library whiob can claim an age of 800 years I may
observa that Bentley, however, did not hold this MS. to be the oldest
source for the text of Plautus. In a noteonTer. Andr. 1v3, 13 he
quotes a line from the Cistellarii 11 l, 25 ‘Ati quaerere ati tao iurando
tao eatis ait eabaidi‚' adding ‘I ta codsa omnium armatas? and this is actu-
ally the reading of B'. In J we find it thus ‘Ati querere ati tao iurando
eatis eit subsidii,' i. e. J agrees bere with Gruter’s fourth Palatina MS.

The eight comedies contained in this MS. are arranged in the same
order which we find in B: Amphitruo Asinaria Aulularia Captiae‘
Oaroahb Casina Cistellaria Epidicus, whiob ends fot 194⁶, so that the
Plautian Me. alone consiste of 81 leaves The space lest on sol 194· is
filled with the following lines:

Exemplar mendum tandem me compulit ipsu
Cunctantem nimiu planta exemplarier ista.-
Ne graspicus³ mandisppnas idiota raptis

Adderet. a liber hic falso patre falsior essa3

These verses, bad as they are, would still lead to the presumption that
the MS. with which we have to deal, was not a mere imitation, but a

Phalaris. London, 1679.
