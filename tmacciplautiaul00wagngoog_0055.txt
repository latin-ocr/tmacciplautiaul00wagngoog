making its way and left permanent traces Ι do not forget that such
strong violatione of natural prosody as those given above, will probably
appear very harbarous to us and I know that many scholare will there-
fore treat them with obstinate incredulity, yet an impartial consideration
cf the matter would show tllat there is at least no sathael differente
between the shortening of at st tt and of ds ts ts os: only the first
we accept, because it remsined short ever afterwards ς the latter
appears strange to us, because the literary language of later times
returned to the original long quantity. To be brief, most people
‘readily acknowledge thesalt 'aecmnpll while they obstinately close their
eyes to the traces left bya destructive and revolutionary power in the
popular speech of a certain period, becarase tha same tendencies were
afterwards purpoeely checked and could not therefore manifest them-
selves in the literary dialect of a more cultivated period But for such
as are determinednot to acknowledge any differcnce between literary
and populandialects, these peges are not destined.

The shortened quantities of these syllables have indeed been doubted
by Ritschl, who in his edition of Plautus geta rid of them partly by
very free conjectures, partly by assuming the extrusion of the radical
vowels of the words in question. I propose to give a brief criticism of
the latter point, in translating a passage from M„ Orain’s excellent
paper ‘plautiashclts stads'ea’ p. 12:

‘Q Hermann (el. d m. p. 65) considers domi boni mall radam aa
monosyllables in many passages, though he has never given his argu·
ments for the possibility of patting together such thorcughly different
cases. In accordante with (l. Hermann‘s views, Ritschl establishes a

monosyllabic pronunciation for eolat opat quidam fores meam sensa
mmm, on which he remarks ‘quac quta tam prosto iudicio est ut correptis
potius ultimis syllabis quom presentiarum elath primis dicta esse cors·
ttadatl' (Proll. Tria. exn. s.) But where are the proofs for the
possibility of extruding a radicnl vowel [in Iambic words] ¹, to preserve

¹ In adopting Mr. (train’s criticism, I do not terget that amongst the numerous
etymologias of Latin words given by Prot. Key we find some ‘compressione’ of
iambis words into monosyllables, e. g. tras is said to be a oompression of an original
tonsa (Trans. of the Phil. Soc. 1856 p. 326). But I believe, Prof. Key himself
would not use a very uncertain, though ingenious, derivation as a proof of an other-
wise hypothetical explanation of Plautian prosody. We shall of course be ready to ·
