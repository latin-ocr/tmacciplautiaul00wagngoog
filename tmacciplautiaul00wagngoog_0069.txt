Every'friend ef Plautian poetry must therefore agree ’111111 the
opiniones Prot Key who calls Ritschl’s text ‘in not a few instances
untrustwerthy‚' because it differs ‘what with emissione, insertion«,
changes and transpositione of words, and not unfrequently of lines, from
what the MSS. sanction, by a very considerable per-centage.’ These
matters will, 'it is hoped, bc all set right in a second impression ef
Bitschl’s Plautus, which is destined to give us the mature resulta os the
indefatigable investigatione of the revered sospitator Plauti.

But we shall stephana, though it would be easy to accumulate more
exemplos ei similar ‘violatione of prosody.’ We use this expression,
although it is entirely false when applied to Plautus or other cornio
writers For them that prosedy which ebtains in Horace and Virgil,
did not exist, and they could not therefore sin against it. Their sole
guido in prosodiacal matters was their ear, and in many cases, they
obeyed the dictatas of the rhythmical, rather than of the quantitative,
lawa of the language. This shows the influenee which the accent

exercised en the quantity of many syllables—a fact not at all te be
