According to Nonius (see crit. note) we should here find a translation
of this Greek or rather Oriental (Preller, 9000010. myth. 1, 158 first ed.)
sabla ; but as the picae (1.0. the woodpecker) holds a marked position in
oid Italian mythology, and was believed to know 01 hidden treasures
(Preller, 0600. myth. p. 298), we are rather inclined to think that Plautus
mixed the Greek grypes and the tales told of their golden treasures with
the common beliefs which were current among his own countrymen with
regard to the woodpecker. The acrei orontes 01 the pici appear only in
this one passage. I may venture to lead the attention ol my readers to
another passage in Plautus, without drawing myself any hasty conclu-

sion from it: Sciet. 24 Persarum montis qai 0000 aare perlibratum
passage which may be compared with some lines from Varro’s satire

Ἀνθρωπουργία (p. 264 ed. Bip.) Persarum meotes, aco diuitis macoma
—The lorm Vites as found in ,1 seems due to a misapprehension oi the
archaia nom. plur. Picis which ie preserved in Bt (000 Introd. p. xxx)
- and which I might have put into the text. It is true we should expect
the accus. Piceo, but the nom. must be explained by supposing the same
kind 01 attraction which we have noticed on v. 566. Ocmp. moreover
