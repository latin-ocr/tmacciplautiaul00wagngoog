mann (see p. nxvn), that the Ms. B reads deminuam, 606 diminuam, as
my text gives in consequence of 660 carelessness of former collatione.
And this is no doubt the genuine reading, comp. the only other Plautian
passage in which this word occurs, 1160. 117, 10 (2558 Geppert) adm
de too 06006666 de mina aaa deminui uredo Quinque nummos, where
deminui is the reading of all 660 Μ68.-010’000’600 or dimmiuuo (this is the
spelling found in B Meu. 304 and Most. 265) 10 quite a different word:
its original composition with die· manifesta itself in the phrases dimmi-
uuere caput (Plaut. Meu. 304. Most. 265. Ter. Eure. 803) and 000οὀ0006
