the mmo recension ee B, though there were several discrepencies be·
tween them 3 but es ιο the present stete of J itsell', it is in every
respect much inferior to B eud must be used with much cantion,
since we cen never know what is reelly due to its archetype or
what ιο its emendator.

The critical commentary ol thie editionis intended ιο give ell
matter necessary to authenticate the readings in the text I do not,
however, aspiro to the minute exaotnese of Riteohl'e Plautus with
regard to the many emendations and conjectures of modern scholare
Ι think it superfluous (at least for the purpose of the present edition)
ιο give the exact references where the reader has ιο look for the
emendations either edopted in the text or mentioned in the notes:
it will, I suppose, suffice in every cese ιο indicate their euthors¹.
Sometimes, however, even e general note ‘cett cdl! will be found ; it
means thet the errore of the MSS. are nlreedy corrected in the editione
defore Camerarius The readings of the editio princepe¹ ere purpoeely
omitted, since they are of no critical velue at all

As regards the leading principles of my criticism, I may say that
Ι heve been more conservative with regerd to the MSS. then Ritsohl
generally is. ‘Nou omncs onmia deceet’ is an old saying and a
true one; and a genius like Ritechl may well venture to take more
liberties with the text of the MSS. then other mortale can scfely
indulge in⁸. 1 may, however, console myeelf with the feet that, by
returning ιο the readings of the same Mes, ιο which he had formerly
paid so little respect, Ritechl himself hes made his beet discoveries in
Letin grammar end in the history ol the language in ite earliest state
A still greater conservatiem reigns in (lorseen's book on Latin pronun-
cieti0n‚ end in Studemund’s dissertation dc canticis Plautium Still,

⁴ Iaveil myseli of this opportunity to mention ior the benefit ol such readers
ae ere not yet ecquainted with it, a psper by Prol. Key ‘Miscehnneous Remarks
suggested by Ritechl's Plautus‚¹ in the Tramactione os the Philoloyical Society
1861 p. 172-197. It is, es ell the papere of Prof. Key, full of excollent remarks,
though there are some points cn which 1 should venture to dissent lrom hie views.
