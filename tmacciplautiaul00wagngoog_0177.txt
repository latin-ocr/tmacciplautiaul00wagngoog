of it to be taken from Plautus' original prologue. Το show my dis·
trust of the originality of the prologne, Ι have adopted tho subscrip·
tionfound in the MS. B(see p. lxv).

o. 4. The construction of this line is somewhat negligent, though
used by Plautus himself in another passage: Perea 137 1111111111
law hoedum aea· measa Megaribus bac cet quom conmigrauit. Hence
may have arisen the French way of expressing the same thought: it
y a beaucoup d’oaaeea qae-. For the explanation of the present
tenses percideo and colo see Ray, Ia G. ξ 14551, note †, and §aba
—colo=inoolo‚ as 1. 693. Here tho notion of paoacliaq the house is
involved, in the samo way as in Virgil’s expression matorum 11111111
Latonia uirgo (Aea. 111 557) not only ‘inhabitant’ but protectress too
is meant

5. patrique auoque ‘for the advantage of-,’ see Key, 1. G. ξ 977.
—laabet=bobitat (cf. v. 21) frequently with Plautus. See Nonius as
quoted in the critical notes.

7. tlwacouraa 11 the true Plautian form which, in consequence of
the thin pronunciation of the lettera (see Kcy, ‘Alphabet' etc. p. 141),
afterwards became 1111111111. In the same way we have Megalensia—
Megalesia, and all the numeral adverbs ending in eac lost their original
a in this manner. See (loressan, oacspr. l, 97 and the introduction
to this edition p. xlia—omnia is acc plur. ‘unknown to all :’ see
Key, L. G. ξ 1319. It is very natural that olom governs the accusa⁴
1111, since it is very probably an adverb formed from the verb aba
and originally may have been alan.

8. The syllables aas 111 at form a dactyl, according to a metrical
law which is explained Introd. p. lxiii.

9. Donatus observes that quoniam is here used in the mere sense
of a temporal conjunction, which the word is logical] y entitled to, being
but a compound of quom and tana Plautus has it sc not unfrequently,
e. g. Trio. 112 quoniam binc 11111111 ipsam ia maiam ibid. 149 qao
aiom laiac profectost ire peregre Charmides. We may observa the same
change of the two notione of temporality and causality in the Ger-
man ccnj. weil, which has now almost entirely lost its temporal sense,
though this was the original one. Nevertheless, Schiller usas it as an
equivalent to the English while, Wilhelm Tell, act 1 so.2 ‘weil ich
ferne bin, suhre du mit klugem sinne das regiment des hauses.‘-The
words ito auido tagenio fait might stand in bracketq at least they do
not influence the construction of the sentence: ‘when he was about
to die, he did not-such was his avaricious disposition-revoat the
secret to his son'

10. id here and v. 8 denotas the secret in general, and must not
