INTRODUOTION. xxxi

⁶ tentiones 001 readers to the two words quidem and cuim, which must
frequently be pronounced as quide and 801ι (Aul. 209. 496 etc).

Even in later poetry, a final m was entirely disregarded, if the next
word began with a vowel, this being the last trace 01 a licence which
had formerly spread over a larger territory.

As 10 8, we have a very memorable passage in Cicero's Orator
48,161 quim etiem quod imre subrusticum uidetur, olim autem politius,
eorum uerborum quorum eaedem eruut postremae duee litterae meuc
808110 ‘optumus' postremam litteram 018110181001, mici uocalis iuce-
quebutur. 110 uou erut 8001180810 iu uersibus quom uuuc fuqe'uut poe'toe
0001110 euim loquebamur ‘quc‘ 881 omuibu’ princepc,' 800 ‘omuibus
princepa’ 81 ί0110111011980 locoque,' ucu ‘deponat'

This licence is known 10 every reader 01 Lucretius, and its exten-
8100 may be shown by a line from Ennius’ Auuules (601 Vahlen)

tum lateralis dolor, certissimus 00111108 11101118.

(10188811 (ousopr. 1, 119 8.) gives a list 01 15 words from inscrip
tious 88 old as the Punic ware, in which a final 818 entirely omitted,
and the same 1801000018 again in inscriptions 01 the decline 01 the
Roman empire. 1t would, therefore, bc very surprising if no traces
01 11 were found in the verses 01 the comic writers As instances 01
11 will bc frequently met with in Plautus, we shall confine ourselves
to some examples from the Aulularia. Thus we should pronounce

miuus: miuu prol. 18. 19.

nimioque = nimique 61.

mimis = ulmi 493.

111101. Key (‘A1phabet' p. 142), Ritschl (Prcll. p. cau. 00111) and Bergk (zeit-
schrift sdr die 011811100181018880801011 1848 p. 1130) assume 8 monosyllabic pronuncia·
tion 01 quidem and cuim. It would be preposterous 10 deny the possibility 01 such 8
fact-and indeed some arguments, especially one alleged 10180101 by Bergk—seem
strongly to point 10 11. Βο1 88 11 cannot be concludcd irem the evidence 01 Plautian
matres, we think it 88181 10 follow 8 general theory which gives us 811 equally 88118-
factory explanation, instead 01 assuming an exceptional pronunciaticn which would
after all not be supported by entirely undoubted arguments.

⁹ The 110111 01 Cicero’s observation ‘quom oum sapiunt podice uoui' may be
exempfifieq by comparing two lines 01 Ε1111108 and Virgil. In Virgil (Am. 111
115) we read Solis equi lucenique 810118 00111108 effluat, 011 which words Servius 1188
the following note ‘Eruimus 001808 est ordire commutato: suadumque 810118 northw
lucem.⁹ (See Ennius ed. Vahlen p. 85 and the passage quoted there 110111 Μ81108
Victorinus.) 'I'he reason which induced Virgil to change the order oi the words
appears 81 01108.
