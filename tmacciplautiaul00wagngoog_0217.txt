. 426. In uenimus and 0101010 110 final consonante should be dropt-
1001110010 here an interjection apparently belonging to conversational
language and which will be frequently met with in the comio writers.
Even Oioero uses it occasionally, e. g. off. 11 15, 13 quae te reatum ratio
10101000 spem 10110011 ‘what the deuce could lead you to suche hopel’
Verr.120‚ 54 quoe mulum est istu tenta audacia atquc amentia? It
always expresses a strong degree of indignation and anger.

question utrum-ue—ere is explained by Key, L. G. § 1425 (with note),

the comio writers Ι cannot find a single instance of utrumne—ua, snd
am therefore now dispesed 10 adopt Studemund's correction utrum crse-
danencurt (‘ de eant’ p. 32). Madvig remarks in general that retrusione
-art 10 confined to poetical usage ; he should have said more appropri-
ately that it belongs 10 the silver age. The example quoted from
Oicero pro Quinctio 30, 92 10 altered in modern editions, although I
cannot at present ascertain on what authority. Other examples are
given from Pliny, Tacitus (diat. de or. 35 and 37), Quintilian, Suetonius
and Columella. The first instance where it occurs, seems to be Oet. 07,

432-437 Ι 11ον0 secluded from the text as a dittography of v. 428-
431. Τ10 1001 origin ef this piece may be seen by comparing v. 432
with 428 (where we should also read coquere hic, see p. nxx), v. 434 with
421. 410. 543, and v. 437 with 451. There is, moreover, ne reason why
Congrio should again begin to quarrel, since Euclio’s words ecio, ree doce,
aaut sufficiently indicate his intention net to listen to any further corn·
pleints ef the cook. It may further be urged that the form 0091010
which we should have to assume for v. 434, is indeed unexampled in
Plautus or any ether poet; Ritschl, dc titulo Alchfnutium p. rx s.
where he gives analogous compressione, does not mention ereptae nor
does Biicheler‚ jahrb. fftr class. phil. 1863 p. 776: Lachmann, 011 Lucr.
