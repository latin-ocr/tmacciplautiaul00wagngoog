Oorssen, ausspm 2, 7 says that it belongs 10110 popular dialects of later
Iatinity‚ and 2, 348 he quotes an Umbrian form amplo. The only pas

433. The spelling sequius is repeatedly found in theold writers in
the place of the mmmon forms accius or aetius. The quantity of thee

of a line of Afranius (Ribb. Com. rell. p. 170), where however the longe
would do equally well: see Ocrssen, aa. beitr. p. 7. Oorssen considers
this line 01 the Aulularia to be an iambic septenarius: quid fecimus,
quid dicimus tibi sequtus quma 0011001 but this metro would bs en·
tirely out of place in the present scene Ι should therefore prefer the
reading 00000 as found in Jr and all the Mss, collated by Hildyard
Oorssen connects aequius (armassemus) with acy-mis: comp. Oia. lv 2,
