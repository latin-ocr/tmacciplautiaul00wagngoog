right (L Miller, l a). In Juvenal we have esto (vn 7 9) and in
Martial respondeto (m 4, 7).

O. DROPPING OF PINAL CONSONANTS.

An accurate student of Plautian prosody will soon observe that,
for scanning Plautian verses, he must very often free himself from the
observance of the rnles commonly taught under the head of positio.
Nevertheless, he will at the same time see that an absolute negation
of the laws of position in Plautus would be even worse, for then we

should be at a loss to explain many cases of naturally short vowels
lengthened by position. Most¹ of the cases referred to will he explained
by the following remarks.

The scotres of Plantae acad Terence testa‘fy o geramel Μάρτιος] of rte
Latia longaoge of their time to drop the final consonante of penny words.
This tendency was not confined to the Latin alone3 on the contrary,
wc find it in most of the dialects of ancient Italy. Thus, to give a few
examples, we have aoetdata=aestipiam fraleta :frictam facia :facias
in Umbrian (florescis, aasspr. l, 41. 46. 29) ¹.

It may be useful to premise thatin many cases the Latin lan-

1 I may add that the same process has taken place in many modern languages.
E. g. a modern Greek is at liberty to say πόδι or πόδιν (= πόδιον, leot), χέριν or χέρι,
χάρι or χάρις ete, nay in modern Greek popular poetry final consonante are very
often cut off where they ought to stand, and even added where they have no gram·
matiani right to appear-The history oi the English language furnishes abundant
instances of all the same praeesses enumerated in this sketch of Plautian prosody:
via. the shortening oi originally long soweie, the dropping of final consonante, the
entire loss of whole inflexione. The English language is, in this respect, more in-
structius than many others, because though flowing from a richly inflected language,

it has now lost almost all its inflexione. It will, in general, be found that all the

lawsdeteiled in the present paper are by no means arbitrarily assumed for a certain
stage of the Latin language, but are in reality only special applicatione oi the

‘general laws which govern the growth and decey of all forms of human speech.
