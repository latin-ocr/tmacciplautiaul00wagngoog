and the first editors did not hesitate ιο find Greek forms and imitatione

about them, or at the best, their notions were very vagus and more

Guyet, a French scholar of the lith century, was the first to study the
versification of the comio poets, and though his results were intermixed

with a great many errors (as, indeed, it could not be otherwise), his
works seem to have given the first impulse to Bentley, if we may trust
ιο the simple fact that many emendations of Bentley’s in Terence are

already ιο be met with in Guyet's ‘commentarii’ nay, even some of his
caprices already occur there¹. It is difficult not ιο say too much of
Bentlcy’s merits with regard ιο Plautus and Terence ς but we may ven.
ture ιο assert that hie edition of Terence will continue a standard book

it would be totally preposterous to think that Bentley’s famous ‘Sclacdi-
asrua’ gives the real key to the full understanding of Plautian prosody
and meires. Gottfried Hermann, who through his excellent feacher

Reiz had early become acquainted with Bentley’s Terence, adopted and
refined his views both in his editions of the Trinummus and the Bac-
chides, and in his ‘Elementa doctrinae maurae where hc has often

¹ I cannot better amount ior this fact than by referring ιο an observation made
by Prot. Fleckeisen on this point in a conversation we had some years ago. The
future editor of an elaborate edition oi Terence was, oi course, well aware ot the
lact in question, and he assured me that in his critical commentary on Terence the
note ‘Bentleiua item Guyetua’ would be seen in many passages He suspected
that Bentley might have read Guyet’s works and copied many of his emendations;
years afterwards, when hs published his own Terence, hs might well have iorgotten
the real author of a great many of the conjectures he found scattered over the
margin ol his copy, and as he approved of them, he took them for his own. But
how is it then, that Bentley sometimes mentions Guyet's name, but only ιο accusa
him of vanity, levity and rashness? And how is it that Bentley is otherwise very
carena to find out the first author of good conjectures, but very careless indeed to
give Guyet his due praise? It is true, Guyet was nothing more than ingenious, a
true French nature in this respect; his judgment never ripensd and Ι can easily
fancy that Bentley could not think much of him. His words on Davies may be
well applied to Guyet ‘laudo equidem conatum et iugenio tuo faueo, quod ubi semei
maturuit, praeclarissimae fricatus dabit. aed opus eat iudicio subacto’ (uate ou Cic.
Tusa. 1125). Guyet reached the age of 80 years, but his iudicium was never
ratacmm. Neverthelees, it would be interesting to possess his book ‘de mosodia
uersuum Terentii et Plauti,’ which his sudden death did not allow him to finish.
