All these forms occur in the metros of tho comic writers: we must,
however, leave it to the industry of our readers to collect as many
exemplos of each separate measure as they find mfficimt for theirovn
conviction Many instanoea of the varied metrical character of ea' are
collected by Ritschl, dc 1119111111ιί1 metricis sch. Plcut.'(Bonnae 1841)

p. 1111.

We shall now briefly enumerate some 111111 most frequent cases

in which i and 11 display their variable nature. Thus we have

11111 = dryas, dic = dyc,

diu = dyo,

ocio = scyo,

1111111 ait'as monosyllables,

1111111111. as disyllables‚

trium = tryum,

otio filio paudite omnio 11111111 rwecio as disyllubles.

On the other hand it should be observed that pretiis and in·
pretiis in Plautus and Terence are always fully pronounced3 in later
times we find protis and inprctio es the predominent forme.

In tuos and 111111111111111111111111111111111 assumes in many
instances the consonante] sound of 11. The same is the case with
many words wherea 11 follows an initial consonant, eg. duo (1111111111
dumam duobus duabus) dccellum' duellica poor puello, or in such an
instance as quattor for quattuor'.

The ver-bal forms fui saciati feriatio fuisse, 111. undergo very often a
synizesis of the two letters cti. saiand fuit may, however, be pro-

nounced in three different ways, via frti sati sall (monosyll.). If we add
the variable quantity of the perfect termination ir (see p. nx), we

arrive at the following possible pronunciatione offuit:
forr fou fou 1111111111).

¹ 111111 and auca are not only not Plautian, but not even good Latin forms. Even
cicero knows no 1111. (ln fluuius the first 11 is the root vowel, the second 1 modifi-
cation ol the guttural 9.)

’The pronunciation duellum was the next precursor to the secondary form
1111111111. In the same way we have 1111111111 (ciconum) tonum.
