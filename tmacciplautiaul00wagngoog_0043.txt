still hae the full forms cocitum caedor ete, as shown by Fleckeisen,
ep. crit. m¹. ln Plautus' time, we find the shortening process in
its full vigour aud working 3 in later times (and we must not forget
that there are more than 100 years between Plautus and Cicero)
those shortened vowels already began to be dropt 'Phe conjecture
that after a consonantal a vowels first began to be dropt‚ the am-
biguous nature of this 0 giving rise to a diphthong, does not seem

without foundation.

Another instance of a shortened e in an imperative of the second
conjugation is 10οἔ Aul. 325. Similarly we find
tend:

adimit animam mi aegritudo : Stasime, tene me :2 uisne aquam?
Prin. 1091.

010 secus, patiemur animis eequis. tene sortem tibi
an. 11 6, 25.

v. 412 of the Aulularia furnishes us with a good example of the
variable quantity of such words,⁴ since we must there pronounee the
first tene as a pyrrhich, but the second as an iamb. A somewhat

analogous instance occurs in Ovid’s line ‘eald 00ίέ inquit et uoao' (see
L Miiller, de re 00. p. 308)¹. We may further enumerate doce* Aul.
431, aidev Trin. 763. Cas 11 6, 26, and iube (see Ritschl Proll. cuxv).
It may be useful to add that the same quantity os the imperative c
of the sec. conj. occasionally re-appears in the Augustae period,
ag. Ovid has saue (am 11 13, 21) and 60οἔ (am 11 6, 62), Persius
(Ι 108) and Phaedrus (1116, 3) have erkle. Ι may be allowed to quote

¹ We may add that even coacto would seem to follow this analogy in two

’ Plautian lines:

mox quom Sauream imitabor, caueto ne suscenseas.
Asin. 112, 105.

atque horunc uerborum eausa caueto mi natus fuas.
Capt. 113, 71:

These passages are, however, very (10001101 and have justly been altered by

Flolkrllsllldiameter in 0 late sepulchral inscription in Burmaun'e Anthology gives

the same prosody (11 p. 154):
semper perpetuo nale, mi carissime coniux.
See Jo. Schrader‘s 1100000ιί0000, p. 218.
