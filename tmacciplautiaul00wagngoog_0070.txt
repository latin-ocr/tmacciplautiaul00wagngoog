The theoly that the natural accent of the Latin was, in the earliest
periodos Latin poetry, an important factor in versification, which
decided its whole character, was first established by Bentley in his
‘Schediasma' Nevertheless, Bentley could not establish this theory
without alloving a difference between natural aud metrical astent in
the first and last dipodies, because without this liberty it would have
been a mere impossibility to transfer Greek melreo and versification
into the Latin language. Bentley had, of course, to correct a great
many passages in Terence which were against his theory, and correct
them he did undauntedly. His theory was adopted by G. Hermann
(el. d. m. p. 141), though with the admission that the pocts to whom it
applied, did not seem to follow it consistently 3 and the same theory is
the groundwork of Ritschl's views as developed in the xv and xv1
chapters of the Prolcyomeno. In the versification of the comio writers,
Bitschl discovers a struggle between a merely quantitative metrical
accentuation and the rcal accent of every-day life According to his
theory, the natural accent of the language still exercised great influente
upon the versification of Plautus and his contemporaries, while it was
entirely disregarded in the Augustam period, when a merely quantitative
system of versification became dominant.

An accurate examination of this theory is due to the joint laboure
of Franz Ritter, A. Bbokh, Weil and Benloew, and (lorssen.

As no theory avails us anything, unless it be confirmed by un·
doubted facts, it will be useful to consider the following proportione
