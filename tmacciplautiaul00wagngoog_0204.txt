Aur ΙΙΙ. ,

Seremus returns from the market with two eooks and two music-girls
whom Megadorus has hired sorthe celebrationes his nuptiale with
Euclio's daughter. In the following dialogus between Strobilus and the
cooks we have a lively, though comically exaggerated picture of Euclio's
meanness and avarica—Comp. Athen. xlv p. 6591) μάλιστα δὲ εἰσά-

Andr. 11 6, 20 where ment of the MSS. give atla, laquel, drachmis ota
natm eat (‘ Vaticanus et nonnulli alii’ ast obeantur) decem and this
would give a very good sense ‘he has spent scarcely ten drachma on
provisions! Bentley, however, adopts the reading of two of his MSS.
est oberratum, iu support of which he compares Plaut Bacch. 12, 35.
Fleckeisen gives the same reading and Parry hns not even a note on the
passage 1 should keep the common reading, which is sufficiently de
fended by the passage quoted from the Stichus—For conduxit tequea
see Pliny as quoted in the critical note 'on v. 397.

281. Congrio plays upon his own name and the expression disper·
tire obsonium used by Strobilus. Under obsonium and ὄψον especially
fist was understood, whence ὀψάριον in the language of the N ew Testa·
ment simply means ‘fish' (comp. the modern Greek ψάρι). Strobilus
having signified his intention to divide the obsonium into two parts,
Congrio replies that he shall certainly not divide him, just as if he was
afraid of being comprehended under the category of fist, the συπρα
beinga kind os ecl, which was cut into pieces before it was oooked
(comp. v. 396). For dispartire he substitutes diuidere, a word which is
sometimes used in an obscene sense: see Petrou. 11 p. 13 Blicbeler.

284. Antrax, the other cook who seems more honest but less witty
than Congrio, oatches at Congrio's expression lc‘e tam polone, and calls
him therefore pudieam prostibulam, adding as his suspicion that Congrio
would perhaps not obstinately refuse to yield to such a proposal, if made
