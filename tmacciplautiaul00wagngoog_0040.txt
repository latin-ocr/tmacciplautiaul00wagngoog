in sera· but in Plautus we find probe with the same short quantity
(Posse. v 5, l. Pseud. 603. Persa 650) ¹. The adverb cito had its final

o common in all periodo of Latin poeti-y'.
The ablativo-ending c of the third deciension was originally long,

eg. in the following line from the sepulchral inscription of Scipio
Barbatus ε

Gnaiuod patre: propratus, tortis uir sapiensque.

In the comio poete, however, this ending is short'.

ι’ in the ablativo of the third declension appears shortened in
sn anapeestic line from Plautus' Bacchides (1108)

igitur peri fortuna, aetate ut sumus, utimur z: sic est. set tu.

This is the reading of the MSS. adopted by Fleckeisen.
The ι’ of the dative is shortened in canl:

cani quoque etiam ademptumst nomen...
Epid. 11 2, 50.

ss of the fourth is shortened in seced Trin. 288. It is the same ι
with the e of the fifth, which is occesionally found short, e. g. Posse. 1v
2, 68 Fece soe melius creditur.

¹ M. Grain, plaut. stud. p. 10. In the line hom the Perse Ritschl expressly
aclmowledges the short finale.

² For Plautus see Bitschl‚ Proll. Tris. p. enum for later poete 11. Miiller, de rc
sectr. p. 335, and on the whole point hey, L. d. 1 772 with note.

Bitschl and Fleckeisen admit even prospere in an anapaestis line, Pseud. 574.
It is. however, highly probable that this line is to be read as a trochaic octonarius:

pro Iouis, ut mihi quidquid ago lepide dmnia prospereque eueniunt.
The MSS. give Iuppiter: I have followed Biicheler's emendation (riwin. mus. xv
p. slep-ln another anapaestic line, G lor. 1024, Ritechl reads with the MSS.
ege, age, dt tibi msxnme concinnumst.
Prof. Haupt proposes to transpose the words es follows

age msxume uti tibi concinnumst.

It is difficnlt to decide how far a licence would extend in the so-called ‘free’ metres;
yet in the first instance we ere entitled to remove it because trochaic metre follows;
in the second I should not sdmit Hsnpt’s conjecture.

⁸ See Oorssen, auceps. 1, ssa-It may be useful to call the attention ol scholare

to sn instance of a longe in the abl. sing. which as yet seems isolated viz. cht.
