IN TRODUG'I'ION . xix

the plural 66166 dtis, and appears therefore in its real quantity in tho
passage alluded to. Thus we have faut and ccidi in Plautus, and 161661 111
Horace (36116. 15, 90). It is the same with 3116 imperfects 66161363 (Eun.
Aen. 314), retrocedat (Verg. Aac. 1 161), amittebat (ibid. 1 8113) ¹, and crdt
(Hor. Sat 11 2, 47)¹. It is 3116 same with the ending ct 61 3116 subjunc-
tive (both present and imperfect⁸)‚ and 61611 Horace has perir& od 111
5, 17. The ending 63 of the future belongs, of course, to 3116 same series⁴.

Nay, even the u in the present of the socelled third conjugation
was originally long, e. g. Plautus has percipit Men. 921, and Ennius
pontt (Ann. 484). Hence we must not he surprised to find similar
unusual long vowels in Horace (ugit Serm. 11 3, 260. figit od 11124, 5.
defendit Serm. 1 4, 82) and in Virgil (61611 Aen. x 433. facit Ecl. 111 23.

petit Aen. 119). An explanation of this quantity is given hy Oorssen,

666161. 1, 353: it will at once be understood by comparing 3116 Iatin

and Greek forms of λέγω and lego:

λέγω lego
λέγεις legia or laycis [ci =i]⁸
lle'ycc(r) legit 01169611.

We find the same quantity again in the third pers. sing. perf. Once,
it is even expressed hythe spelling ei=r, Marc. 530, where the MS. A
gives redirit, and it is well proved hy many instances in Plautus and
Terence⁶, to which we have to add about eight different examples from
virgil, Horace and Ovid—The same remark applies 363116 subjunctive

In 31116 11116, Bitschl and Fleckeisen insert leno after 66 and consider 61616136 116
monosyllabic. This word seems however not indispensably necessary, and I am
inclined 36 read the words in accordenoe with the MSS. Prol- Sauppe proposes to
read: 666166 11111116 initiarer (ind. schol. Gott. 1831). 4).
