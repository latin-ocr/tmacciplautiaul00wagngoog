voc. ois constantly long. We ffnd it long again in some lines of Livius
Andronicus, Naevius and Ennius (Aura 148. 484. 319. 433. 305 ed.

Vodlera), and in a hexameter in the sepulchral inscription which
Plautus is said to have compcsed for himself:

scaenast desertd: dein Risus Ludus Iocusque. ’

11 is therefore by no means surprising to find that Plautus uses the
same quantity in several passages of his comedies This fact had al-
ready been acknowledged by Lindemann in Trio. 11 1, 28¹, and in
about a dozen passages by Weiss, but it was again rejected by Ritschl.
Nevertheless‚ Prof. Key was right not to be daunted in stating the fact
Lat. Gram. § 88 p. 13 (5 ed). Corssen gives three instances os it in ,
Plautus (dmspr. 1, 330): Fleckeisen has 18 in his excellent paper on
this subject⁸‚ but there probably are still more to be discovered. One

as in the nom. of the second declension is occasionally found long in

Naevius: ¹

dein pdlldns sagittis inclutus arqultenens

sanctus Delphis prognatus Prilius Apdllo⁴.

There are, however, no instances of this quantity to be met with in

Plautus, at least so far as our present knowledge goes 3 but he uses

sometimes

dds (dat. and abl plur.) as a long syllable:¹ see Aul. 376. Mero. 919.
Most. 1118. Mera. 842 . The same quantity appears in Virgil,Aera1v64⁸.
The ending or in nouus cf the third declension is frequently long.
That it was originally long, might he concluded from the genitive dria
and from a comparison with the Greek ωρ. Thus we have aordr Poen.

1 De prosodia Plauti p. x in his second edition ο1 the captiui, Miles glo-
riosus and Trinummus Lipsiae 1844. une last editor of the Trinummua Mr
Brix, gives the passage in question in accordance with Lindemann, though he seems
unaware of this precedence. The instance which Mr Brix quotes from Ter. Her.

prol. 2 is very doubtful.
¹ See his index in his edition of Plautus, Quedlinbnrg1838. Weiss is one ο1

those unfortunate editors whose books are much used and little praised: but his
index is really praiseworthy.

ences always apply to the readings of the MSS„ which are however generally
altered by Bitschl.
