xxii mraoouonou.

The abl awdd (which must nothe oonfounded with the particle)
stands as a pymhich Aac. 589:

eidem mode seruom ratem esse amanti ero aequom ctnseo

and Pseud. 569, where the MSS. give this reading¹,

nont modo, nouom aliquid inuentum adferre addecet.

In this case, the words nouo modo are to be taken as a proceleusmae
tic, a foot which is very frequent in the first place of a senarius (see
Ritsohl, Proll. Transeamus). With the same quantity we have in
the Priouwmtus 602

quomodo tu istuc, stamme, dixti, nostrum erilem issium

Lachmann (on Lucretius p. 116) calls the short quantity of this o
‘mirabile2’ Prof. Key, to avoid the unwelcome acknowledgment of
such a fact, proposes the monosyllabic pronunciation mo, and tc cor-
roborate this conjecture, he appcals to the Roman way of abbreviating
the word: mo (‘Alphabet' p. 141). But I may observo, that by abbre-
viating the orthographical appearance of a w'ord, nothing is insinuated
as to its pronunciation⁹. Prof. Key’s other argument is drawn from the
Romania languages‚ where quomodo appears in the shape of corn como

oocrc comme: it would, no doubt, prove that chmodo really soundcd

like quoram (coam) in the latest period of the Latin language‚ but would

it explain the real nature of the general law whose slow but steady
working at last degraded full words and endings to poor cripplesl We
recognise in Plautian prosody the beginnings and the first germs of a
depravation of the Latin language‚ which carne at last to a full develop-
ment in the Romania languages. We shall, therefore, not hesitate to
explain Romania forms from such shortened endings as wc find in
Plautus but we shall be very cautious in remodelling the pronuncia-
tion of Plautian forms after the analogy of Romanic forms. The
spirit of modern philology requires that the order of time should be

observed and teaches us not to blend the peculiarities of the different

¹ Bitschl omits inuentum and vthus restores modo to its usual measure. I am

glad to see that Fleckeisen does not follow his example.
² Π e. g. you would take the copy-books of a German student as a measure of

his pronunciation‚ you would arrive at a great many surprising discoveries in
German pronunciation; but I am anuo, they would all be repudiated by the actual

pronunciation ol those studente themselves.
