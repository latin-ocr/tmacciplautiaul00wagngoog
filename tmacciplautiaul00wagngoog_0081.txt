him, simply because in such cases aslight orror yon his side might eccm

more easily than where he purposely states the reading of the MS.

Any statement without the express addition of the name of a MS,
applies to B. In some instances, Ι have found it necessary to complete
. my statements with regard to J : my friend E. R. Horten at London
had the hindness to inspect all such passages as Ι was not quite
certain of.

In the first 80 lines, I have occasionally mentioned some readings‘of
a MS. at Cambridge (see p. vm) written in the same year as my MS. γ.
By rhe'kindness of the Rev. J. E. Β. Meyer, Iam in possession of a very
accurate collation of this MS. for the first 80 lines of the Aulularia, for
which Ι am very much obliged to the learned gentleman, themora bess
cause ho kindly bestowed his attention on so very bad a MS. as δ (this
mark I choose for ir).' Compared with δ, the MS. ybears a much higher
character. In δ, the verses are written as prose, only sometimes we
may guess at the original distribution of the verses in the MS. from

which it was copied, capital letters suddenly appearing in tho prose in

places where a verse should commence.

In some passages, Ι think that I have now succeeded in finding out
the true reading by way of better and more methodical conjectures than
Ι could formerly offer. These δεύτεραι φροντίδες are all mentioned in the
following ‘Addenda' Ι especially want te draw the attention of my
readers to v. 134, this being a memorable instance how frequently the
Ἰ discovery of tho easiest emendations will escape even to repeated at-
tempts. In this passage I have every reason to regret my πρῶται
φροντίδες.
