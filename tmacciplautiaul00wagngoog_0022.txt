vi INTRODUOTION.

In the first instance (Glor. 361) ollcccom is still visible, but has been
corrected and changed into od mona From this one example, we
may reasonably suspect that other instanoes ol the same spelling were
frequently found in the archetype ol B, which were, however, obliterated
by later revisions. Now, this spelling is prevalent in J, i. e. proclitics
acad enclities esre generally written together with their respective words, ³
although Ι do not remember having found euch assimilatione as in the five
instances quoted from other MSS. The same is observed in the MS.
οἰ Oicero's Tusculana and the extract from Isidor referred to, and in a
curiom MS. of the fourth boolr of Martianus Capella (Hoclcioncs 3825,
sace. ix). Prof. Key reports the same ol a MS. of Livy in the British
Museum, though unfortunately he does not stete its probable age ¹. I
have no doubt that many other MSS, is closely inspected, would show
the same peculiarity of spelling. Its antiquity is proved by its fre-
quent occurrence in very old inscriptions and by the testimonias of
Priscian, Servius and evenes Quintilian 1 5, 272 ‘cum dico circum
litora, utinquam unam enuntio dissimulato distinetione, itaqua tcm-
qiwsct io unc coca unc cst acuto: qood idam occidit ic illc: Troiae
qui primus aberis? Priscian says p. 977, ‘cum annitatur scope prae-
positio acqcccti dationi ct quasi cna pars cum cc piaretur! The whole
subject has been treated by Consentiae· cesepruclce, cobolismcs cod

¹ See addendum to Key’s Latin Grammar ς 1465.

² The subject is, however, not yet exhausted, at least not so far as it touches
Latin versification. Itis my opinion (as will appear irem the second part oi this
Introduction) that Latin poetry was, from the very oldest times down to the period
oi its extreme degeneratiom under the absolute dominion ol quantity: still, it can·
not be denied in Latin poetry the common accent was ol greater influence than in
Greek. A careiul observation ol the enclities and proclities oi the Latin would, no
doubt, throw much light on many passages where we now consider metrical accent
to be different irom the common pronunciation oi Latin prose. Proi. Key has some
excellent remarks on this head in a Paper ⁶ on Greek accentuation‘ (Tromactiocs os
the Philoloyicol Socicty 1855 p. 135 ss.)
