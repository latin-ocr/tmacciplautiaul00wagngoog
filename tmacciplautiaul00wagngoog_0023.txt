Ι have not, however, adopted thie way of writing, simply because it ¹
was never nniformly employed by the Romane themselves and seems to
aries altogether from *the habitual pronunciation, unless it was in some
cases purpoeely adopted in consequence of grammatloal theoriae.

. These general remarks may suffice for the present: in my critical
commentary Ι have not thought it necessary to repeat the express
statemente as to this peculiarity of writing on every occasion 3 on the
contrary, Ι have oeased to do so after the first 250 lines

The latest MS. Ι have made use otis

(3) y, codsa Horleicaue ac. 5285, containing the first eight comedies .
ueatly written in a hand of the 15th century. It consiste of 97 leaves
and hae the Aulularia at the end after the Epidicus. After the last

line of thie play we read the following subscription:

The text of this MS. has been revieed and corrected by at least thrcs
hands, but wherever the first ¹hand is still legible, it gives almost always
the mmo reading as found in J. The correctione made by other hands
give us a fair idea of the critical labours which learned Italians be-
stowed on Plautus in the ldth century. One of the former possessore
of the MS. has been very careful in adding all the quotations by Nonius
in the margin, and eo far as Ι have examined this point, he ie not guilty
of any omission. -

Muscam, which are enumerated in Hildyard’s ‘Recensus Codiouru' in
his edition of the Aulularia (Cambridge 1839). Hildyard promises to
give all their readings, and if he really did, his commentary would be
an interesting collection of the various readings of a great number of
late MS& But Ι mayobserve that Hildyard apparently omits many
varieties which he considers to be of lese importanoe: newertheless, Ι

have sometimes found his notes of some use, inasmuch as they enabled
meto traoe some emendations back to their first origin. In other
respecta, all those MSS. are quite worthless; if we have older authori-
ties-and such Β] undoubtedly are-later MSS. have only a very
