This kind 01 hiatus most frequently 000111 when the long vowel (or
a vowel together with m) forms the first syllable 01 11 arsis resolved
into two shorta This may bc exemplified by comparing the following
passages in the Aulularia: arg. 1 2. nae at id 8. quoi ego 181. quo

———-—-.—

Only a few concluding words Thr-oughout this chapter, I have
endeavoured to keep free from merely hypothetical theorias which have
been brought forward for the explanation of Plautian prosody. ‘Diffieile
est et labnmm’ says Ritsohl Proll. Prin. p. cxavrr, ‘qaid 111101 0011001110
aeternna probam 1101 potuerat ael non potnerit, assequi ratiocinando et
comminiscendo aelle! Ritsohl's own investigations, 10 follow which in
their gradual development, is one 01 the most instructius and interest
ing studies, prove the truth of this observation. Yet the history of his
investigatione seems 10 teach 1 lesson which will most likely be the
basis for the labours 01 the coming time, via that we gain and learn
more and arrive at more stabla results by means 01 1 critical and con-
servative observation of single facts than by specions but unsound
emendations 01 seeming irregularities¹. It is the heartfelt wish 01
every lover of Plautian poetry,to 100 the continuation 01 that grand

monument of Ritsohl’s name, his edition 01 Plautus It will, however,

probably be a long time before Ritsohl comesto emend the Ardnlaria,
and this consideration alone could move the present editor 10 pub-
lish his own labours on· this play. He ventures to hope that in the
meantime this work will be found not quite an unworthy substitute for
the labeum 01 a great master of philology.

be done 10 the emendation 01 Ρ111111 hythe conservative labours of Spengel and
Studemnnd, the latter ot whom is now collating the Plautian MSS. in Italy. Though

received the first news of its appearance-I may state that I have independently
arrived at the same resulta with regard to the admission of the hiatus as those

which Spengel developea inhia work: seejatrb. 1866 p. 57 1.
