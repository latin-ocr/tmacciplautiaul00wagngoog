rnraonncnor. xiii

Ι should be very sorry to learn that Ι had ever sinned against Bentley’s
immoltal law ‘rationem potiorem esse cet centum manusmaptc’a': though
I baveno doubt that some of the best emendations in the Aulularia
will still have to be found out, and I may hope that the present
edition will contributa towards their discovery. Ihave only to add that
all deviations from BJ in the text are marked by italica, a fact which,
it is hoped‚ will be of some assistance to such readers as want to
know how far they ean safely rely on the given text without always
troubling themselves to look down into the notes.

Anyone who undertakes the reading of Plautus and Terence being
only acquainted with the rules of prosody and versification which he
has learnt sor Virgil and Horace, will be sorely puazled to make out
the verses of'the above two comio poeta: he will indeed find it not lesa
difficult than Horace himself whose metrieal principles are implied in
the line ‘legitimumque sonum diqitc'a callemus et aare’ (ara poet. 274).
But the ears of those Romans for whom Plautus wrote his plays, were
by no means the same as those of the contemporaries ol Horacepand it
would be more than an anachronism, it would ba tha greatest injustice
to the old poeta, if we were to measure their versification by the refined
laws of the Augustan period, or to blame them for not having adapted
their verses to rules unknown to them. ¹'l'he principle which should
gulde us in our judgment ol the verses of the oomie poets, is pointed
out by Cicero, Orator 55, 184 ‘comicorum macrii propter similitudinem
sermonis aie saepe aunt abiecti¹‚·cct noa numqaum aaa c’n eis nameus ct
uermes imclleqi possit} and in another passage, 051. 20, 67 ‘apud quoa
(aa comicos poetae), reici quod veraculi cunt, citit cac aliud quotidiani
duania armonia* These two passages must teach us how to deal
with Plautian verses and language. Nevertheless, the truth was not
found out for more than two centurias after the discovery of Plautus,
