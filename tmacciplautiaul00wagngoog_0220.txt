462. 111 all the passages where wodrgae occurs, it gives the expres
sion a sarcastio or ironical colouring: eg. Poeta 1111 condigne 110
mapsa, 1000 totae trioboli-aiebat 1101100111οϋ11 ie what else could
Ι have expected? Coa1l, 43100111 01 condano te aaa (1.0. very
badly) curabitur. See also uastata. 1110109063 only Oopt 12, 22
the adverb has no ironical sense—gallinaceus is the quantity of this
word in Plautus, Lucilius, Titinius (126 Ribb.) ¹and Phaedrus: see
Lachmann on Lacr. p. 36. I should however have adopted the spelling
gallinacius which is found in ιῘγ and indicated by gallinatius in B: for
this is the actual reading of that MS„ according to Schwarzmann’s
collation. Biicheler (1110110. mas. xx 441) quotes the spelling gallinacius
from the best authorities in Varro Ὀνος λ 11, Oiesro Mar. § 61, Phae
drus 111 12, 1, Patron 86 and an inscription Orelli 4330. In tho
same way we have the solitary formation atrocius in a fragment 01
‘Varro's Meleager (000 Riese, 110110. mus. xxr 121).

463. In some editions the perverse scansion qut erat aaut paediam
is found, though this violatas the legitimate quantity of psaltim...

sarrsptat' Trin. 250, where in scanning the line we should either substi-
tute sumptu or sumpti. But still it would be better to write aaa, just
as we do not hesitate to write fide, where the metro would not bear
fidoi-The adverb poenmsame reours v. 660. That the first syllable
should be spelt with a diphthong‚ appears from Priscian who in two
passages declares pacatissime to be the superlative ofpoenc: see Ritschl’s
note on Most. 656. This derivation is also borne out by the meaning
‘very nearly.’

464. The spelling scalpurrire stands not only in Jt, but in B
too (000 p. axx) end should therefore be admitted into the text 'The
word appears to 1100(ἷπ.λε).1111011)1 no means a desiderative, in
which cass the a would be short and we ought to have scalptam (as
indeed most editors perversely read: 00111. also scalpturae κατακνάω Gloss
